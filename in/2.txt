	People who have arthritis or are otherwise mobility challenged may find walking around to be painful and in some cases impossible.  For these people a mobility scooter may be the best way to overcome these obstacles. There are several types of mobility scooters available, but they can generally be divided into 2 categories: 3-wheel or 4-wheel.If you are going to be using your mobility scooter indoors then you will likely want to use a 3-wheeled mobility scooter. 3-wheeled mobility scooters have a much smaller turning radius, which makes them much more maneuverable. Typically a 3-wheeled mobility scooter can turn in about a third less space than a 4-wheeled mobility scooter. Most travel scooters utilize a 3-wheel design. Travel scooters are mobility scooters that are designed to be taken apart and transported easily and without the need for a vehicle lift. The reason most travel scooters utilize the 3-wheeled design is because they are more maneuverable and can be made to weigh less.  4-wheeled mobility scooters are not as maneuverable as a 3-wheeled mobility scooter, but they are usually more stable. This is because the weight is spread out more evenly and also allows them to support higher weight loads. Their increased stability also typically makes them better for outdoor use. While typically the front wheels on a 4-wheeled mobility scooter are the same distance apart as the back wheels, a company called ShopRider has several models that place the front wheels much closer together. This still provides more stability than a 3-wheeled mobility scooter, but helps to lower the turning radius of the devices. Whether you decided on a 3-wheel or 4-wheel mobility scooter, it is important to carefully read the manual and follow all safety instructions. When used properly they will provide safe dependable service.
