Celexa.....?|7|I&#039;ve been perscribed celexa (low dose, 20mg)but haven&#039;t started it yet. They said no alcohol but I like to drink wine with my dinner and maybe a few beers now and then. Anyone know the effects of this?|I am on Celexa as well, and you are advised not to drink while on any type of anti-depressant or anti-anxiety pill, as they could have create an adverse reaction or cause the medication not to work as well as it should|i am on celexa but don&#039;t  drink alcohol.  with any anti-depressant you are advised not to drink.  if you really want to know then talk to your doc and see what he says.|I have been taking antidepressants for many years, and im taking citalopram (celexa) since a week ago.You shouldnt drink wine or alcohol while taking celexa, as well as other medicins. I take some alcohol, but that depends on your body, once it gets used to the drug, you can take some wine. But in the first months of treatment you should avoid alcoholAlways ask your doctor, he will be able to answer you better(Sorry for the mistakes, english is not my first language, I speak spanish)|I used to be on it and the only side affect was weight gain...i had a beer every now and then and it just made the alcohol affects more severe.....you really shouldn&#039;t drink with those meds without knowing how it will affect you..|Alcohol is a depressant...  So you really should avoid alcohol if you are trying to recover from depression.  Mixing alcohol with some anti-depressants can be fatal...  Speak to your pharmacist about the interaction between Celexa and alcohol; he will know probably better than your doctor.God bless!|It&#039;s gonna **** YOU UP!
Can taking Celexa interfere with the ability to get pregnant?|2|I&#039;m trying to have a baby. I&#039;m taking Celexa and I didn&#039;t know if taking the medication would make it harder to get pregnant.|after reading tons of stuff on the detailed information which accompanies my bottle of Celexa. I see nothing that says it can prevent pregnancy. It can lower sexual drive/desire.
What is the difference between Celexa and Welbutrin?|3|I am on Celexa for depression and today i have been switched to Welbutrin and I am just wondering what the difference between the 2 are? Also I used to take Celexa at bedtime with my Trazadone to sleep Now I am told to take the Welbutrin during the day... Has any one noticed they were sleepy from taking it ?|one is for depressionand one is for anxiety|I DID NOT WRITE THIS THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THIS NAME IS - David Kahn Celexa, or citalopram, is a type of antidepressant known as an SSRI, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.It increases the activity of a neurotransmitter in the brain called serotonin. Other medications in this family include Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Paxil (paroxetine), and Lexapro (escitalopram). Lexapro is very closely related in its molecular structure; the others share the same mechanism but are very different in their chemical structure.Wellbutrin, or bupropion, has a different mechanism of action which is not as clearly understood, but it does not directly affect serotonin, working instead on other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and adrenalin. Wellbutrin comes in several forms; &quot;SR&quot; means sustained release, while &quot;XL&quot; means extended release - there is little difference here. Without the letters SR or XL, plain bupropion is a tablet that releases the drug into the blood stream a little more rapidly than the others. The slow release forms are no more effective but can be taken just once or twice a day instead of 2 or 3 times a day. There are no other drugs that are related to Wellbutrin.Both medications will help a similar perecentage of depressed patients, roughly 60% of individuals. Celexa is somewhat better when anxiety is present, and also treats anxiety disorders (panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety) in individuals who are not especially depressed. Its major side effect is sexual dysfunction in up to 50% of patients, and mild weight gain in perhaps 25%. It is sometime sedating and sometimes can cause upset stomach. Wellbutrin is free of sexual side effects and does not cause weight gain, and is slighly stimulating; it can sometimes cause insomnia or anxiety. Very rarely, it can cause a epileptic seizure if the dose is too high, and for this reason should not be used by people who have epilepsy or any neurological condition that could make a seizure more likely. The slow release forms are believed to be less likely to cause a seizure, but I emphasize again that this is a very rare occurence.Neither medication is &quot;better&quot; for depression; it just depends on the person, and what types of symptoms or side effects are of greatest concern. Some people will do better on one than the other, and some people do best on the combination if neither medication works perfectly by itself.
How long do the harsh side effects of Celexa persist?|3|About 4 days ago I started taking Celexa for anxiety and depression, 20mg/day.  The first day I felt no effects.  Days 2 and 3 were great.  The anxiety and depression seemed to just evaporate.  Now I&#039;m on day 4, and the medicine is still working, but a lot of side effects have kicked in, including nausea, vomiting (4 times this morning alone), diarrhea, dry mouth, excessive sweating, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes.  How long do these effects usually persist?  Should I just cease my dose?|These doesn&#039;t sound like side-effects from celexa. My guess is that the symptoms are not from the celexa, but that you&#039;re sick for a totally unrelated reason. The big clue is the lymph nodes: this suggests some kind of infection. You could have food poisoning or something else. Best to call your doctor.|Celexa is terrible.  Call your doc immediately, and as soon as you get approval, get off of it.The half life is like 36 hours, so it&#039;ll take about 4-5 days to be out of your system, entirely.I wish they&#039;d take that stuff off the market!!Ask your doc for a different SSRI.  All the others are better (but someone today said don&#039;t take Paxil...I don&#039;t know about that...).  Lots are great.  Celexa should be off the market!!
Is there a corrolation between back pain and Celexa?|3|I&#039;ve read that Celexa withdrawls can cause it, but I just realized that since I&#039;ve been off it my back pain is almost completely gone. I can&#039;t find anything anywhere that explains this. Help?|Hmmm that&#039;s interesting.  First I&#039;d try and find something on the internet to see if you can explain this.  You may want to ask your doctor for your own knowledge, or any pharmacist would know.  And it could always have maybe been just a co-ink-ka-dink ;) ... if you can&#039;t find an explanation, it could just be you, different people react different.  Ask a pharmacist and see what he says, and go from there :)|sorry i dont know about this
My goal is to replace my current Wellbutrin and Celexa regimen for PMDD with Yaz. How do I taper off both?|2|I am currently taking 300mg of Wellbutrin and 20 mg of Celexa daily but want to get off of these meds and take Yaz for PMDD. How can I safely taper off the Wellbutrin and Celexa and should Yaz be sufficient for PMDD by itself? I don&#039;t want to stay on all three if at all possible.|I dont know the best way to taiper the drugs off, but YAZ is amazing!!!!
Is it possible to feel out of sorts after missing a dose of celexa?|4|I have been on celexa 20 m for 2 weeks now. I forgot to take it yesterday and all day today i have felt kinda tired and irritable. Does anyone know if this is normal. Thanks!|Yes this is perfectly normal to feel this way. Just make sure to take your Celexa today though at whatever time you normally would. Never double up on a dose. I you are still not feeling better tomorrow,call your doctor and get their opinion. Also,a lot of times you will feel more tired and irritable around that time of the month. Especially if you&#039;ve only been taking the Celexa for 2 weeks.  You may also want to talk to your doc about when to increase your mg&#039;s if you are not feeling better soon.|gee thats how i feel all the time no matter if i miss or not.. so i guess i would have to say yes it&#039;s normal to feel that way|no, it takes 6 weeks to start to work
Is it normal to feel just a little bit better after 2 weeks on Celexa?|5|I&#039;ve been on Celexa for two weeks for depression, very low dose (10mg). I know this is probably an obvious question, but I feel the need for someone to tell me things are going to get better. I definitely feel like there&#039;s been some improvement so far, but I&#039;m far from where I want to be. Is this how it works? Do you gradually start to feel better as time goes on?|all meds work different for diffent people if you are feeling a little better then thank god for that and just give it time you will make it..and i know sometimes TIME is a hard word|Celexa is for depression and not bipolar. After 2 weeks it made me feel a little better. However not enough. You need to let you psychiatrist know how you are feeling. He will probably say wait one more week, because it usually takes 3 weeks to work it&#039;s best. There is also a good chance that you may need an additional med to go with Celexa or change to a different on. Celexa was good, and I know a lot of people that it has helped, but just as many have need something in addition, or to change meds. Make sure you call your psych and keep him informed. Don&#039;t just think he knows how you are doing because he know about all the drugs. They affect each person different. Also see a therapist, to help you through this black hole and help you learn what does this and how to handle different things when you are well enough. The other person suggested natural remedies. Fish oil is excellent. But check out the risks, because some can hurt you.|With prescription meds you need to understand that you&#039;re not gonna pop a pill and wake up the next day feeling &quot;amazing&quot;. It&#039;s a struggle. And while I feel there is certainly a place for anti-anxiety meds in society, especially for those dealing with bipolar disorder and other &quot;more severe&quot; afflictions, meds aren&#039;t the end-all-be-all for dealing with periods of excessive anxiety and panic.Look at some of the natural programs on the following website. These can completely change your thought-process. I know because one of the products worked for me.|It takes about 3 weeks for it to really kick in. Now if you still don&#039;t feel up to par, contact your doctor and he can adjust it.
Celexa and Pregnancy?  Has anyone taken Celexa while pregnant and can share the results?|5|I researched the internet and can only find questions from people asking the same question as me but haven&#039;t heard from anyone specific as to whether they went through a pregnancy on celexa and whether everything went fine. Any information would be useful. Thanks!|I don&#039;t take Celexa and you should talk to your doctor. The internet has so many different opinions. I took 100mg of Trazodone and 300mg of Effexor. This is for my anxiety and depression. I would have panic attacks all the time with out the medication. When I became pregnant my psychiatrist told me to take 50mg of Trazodoen and I still take 300mg of Effexor.I hate taking the medication and would rather be off, but that is not possible. I would like to try to breast feed but with the medication I don&#039;t think its possible. I will take to my psychiatrist about breast feeding.GoodLuck|hi darlin i used to take that! but i went off of it when i was pregnant only because it was by choice.now here is the thing i live in missouri and i saw on T.V not to long ago about celexa and pregnancy it was one of the commercials talking about if you took the product celexa while pregnant and you or your baby had problems you may have a lawsuit type thing and i can&#039;t remeber what it was but i,m not sure what the affects were but i would ask a specialst obgyn just to ease your mind|Celexa is a class C drug which means that they havent tested it on human pregnancies, only animal pregnancies and dont know how it will react in humans.  You might talk to the doctor about switching to something like Prozac which more women might have experience in taking while pregnant.|I don&#039;t take Celexa, but I take Lexapro, which I know is in the same family. I take it for severe anxiety and depression. My OB and I talked about my taking during pregnancy, and she was of the opinion that it was fine for me to keep taking it because anxiety and depression can worsen in pregnancy. I take a very low doseage--10mgs a day. My pregnancy was fine. My son is perfectly healthy. My doctor told me the only antidepressant she will not have her patients on is Paxil because it poses many risks to the baby. Of course, you need to talk to your own family doctor as well as your OB to find out what they recommend.
What&#039;s the difference between Lexapro and Celexa?|2|I couldn&#039;t afford Lexapro, so they prescribed me with Celexa.|Nothing really, they are both antidepressants. I take celexa and my mom take lexapro.
What are some side effects you have found while taking 40mg of Celexa?|3|I am currently on Celexa and I take 2 pills a day.  40mg.  What are some side effects that you have found while taking this pill?  It helps me in terms of depression but I find it makes me tired.  Have you felt this?|This does not belong in alternative medicine.|I just started it and I&#039;v ebeen feeling exhausted                          Report Abuse
Has anyone taken celexa for postpartum depression and how long did yours last?|3|I had my son 6 weeks ago and symptoms started within days, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, extreme anxiety, and not wanting to see anyone.  I have a history of depression so after one week of this I called my dr and he put me on 10mg of celexa.  I still am having trouble.  Anyone else go through this and how long did it last?|I went through this with my daughter. I actually took St.Johns Wort and it seemed to help. Shortly after I started taking it, I started feeling like myself which was about 1 month after taken it, but overall it lasted 4 months.|I hated celexa.  It made me feel like a robot, I didn&#039;t get upset over anything.  I was completely emotionless.
How long does the celexa stay on your body when you stop taking it?|5|It s a citalopram hbr the name of it a celexa i took it for 4 days and i admit it make me feel better am less nervous and it help me get over with my depression it feel funny on me. But the bad thing is i can t get hard like it stop my reproductive system like when a girl come over i won t get hard enough so that why i want to stop taking it for a while i will try to take it if i really need it that the side effect i had. I think when your nuts burst  you get nervous  so it block that you have to work extra hard to get that out. My friend told me they sell some healthy tablet that mix with vegetables in the stores that don t have no side effect.I don t know i will get down syndrome i really to take that chance.|Since you seem to be having sexual side effects that are interfering with your normal functioning, I would talk to your prescriber about trying a different medication.  The Celexa may not have had time to give you the therapeutic benefits for which it was prescribed, but by no means should you start or stop a medication like this without consulting your physician.|If it have a effect on you stop taking it for a while and see what happens try to take it when it neccessary but try not to take it everyday If you don t get hard it could look bad when you have a girlfriend and no girl what a man when there penis can&#039;t go hard or you what to have sex but you can&#039;t but there other side effects do you might get side effect if you stop taking it a long time but don&#039;t worry it won&#039;t stay long in your body it will wear off maybe about a week.|celexa is an SSRI like prozac.  Its half life is only about 30 hours so it should wear off fairly quickly.  It is not a medicine you should start and stop frequently because you will only get the side effects without the real benefits which take about 6 weeks to truly feel. By the way I prescribe if frequently for premature ejaculation.  Sexual side effects are common and will go away within a week of stopping it usually.  Talk to your Doctor about Wellbutrin.  It is a good antidepressant without the sexual side effects.  I would recommend avoiding the vegetable aisle.|i think two weeks but i don&#039;t know i just gues
How Long after taking Celexa  To Drink Alcohol?|2|I just started taking Celexa 20 mg which is generic for citalopram..It says to aviod Drinking Alcoholic Beverages when taking this medication, My question is Do i have to wait serveral days or weeks before i can have a Alcoholic Drink or can i just skip the medication for the day i plan on having a drink?|Just take the med and leave it a week.

I was wondering if any one else is experiencing the same thing? Or if they know of any other medications for anxiety with low side effects? Please help me anything would help natural or prescribed!

What are the side effects from stopping Celexa?|4|What are the side effects from stopping Celexa?|Also known as &quot;SSRI cessation syndrome&quot;, SSRI discontinuation syndrome is a fairly rare medical condition which arises as a result of interruption/discontinuation of an SSRI treatment of four or more weeks. The symptoms associated with discontinuation syndrome may also occur as a result of decreased SSRI dosage. I learned all about it as I weaned myself off the relatively short-acting SSRI Celexa, but the symptoms have also been reported for Zoloft and Paxil. In severe cases, patients may be switched to Prozac for the weaning-off process, as the latter&#039;s longer half-life results in a more gradual transition period, and milder symptoms.Here are the symptoms:dizziness (vertigo) lightheadedness nausea and/or vomiting anxiety insomnia vivid dreams irritability lethargy dull headache electric shock-like sensations (tingling) sweating tremors diarrheaDiscontinuation syndrome may appear as soon as within 24 hours of the discontinuation/interruption/reduction of dosage, or after as long as a week (as it did with me), depending on the half-life of the SSRI used, patient&#039;s body chemistry, etc. Likewise, the symptoms may last anywhere from a day to three weeks. The best way to avoid discontinuation syndrome is to stop taking an SSRI by gradually decreasing one&#039;s dosage before ceasing to take it entirely.|more agitation and restlessnesshand tremorssevere stomach crampsnauseabloating and abdominal painlower back paindizzinessexcessive tiredness and insomniaweight gainbowel problemsmild stomach painemotionally unstablefeelings of self loathingdesire to harm oneselfsadness and numbnessfrustratration good luck!|Don&#039;t stop any meds without the Dr&#039;s help.

What is a &quot;SAFE&quot; Amount of beers when on Celexa / Anti-Depressants?|9|Well I am going upstate this weekend, but unfortunately I take 40mg of Celexa everyday for Anxiety. But I want to be able to get a nice little buzz when I go away for these 2 or 3 days. Everyone else will be drinking and I want to be to. This sucks, anyone have any tips?BTW, is non alcoholic beer safe to drink? Like I could have 4-8 of them without having any problems?Thanks!|Really, most antidepressants say right on the side of the bottle to not drink alcoholic beverages while taking them.  However, I&#039;m not a hypocrite.  I have, but I&#039;ve had blackouts and bad experiences as a result.  I finally said enough and said time to hit the O&#039;douls.  The non-alcoholic stuff.  I had the taste I wanted without the god awful side effects!!!!If you feel pressured or embarrassed about drinking &quot;non-alcoholic&quot; beer, pull your server or bartender off to the side and request that they pour it into a glass and discard the bottle.  No one but you and your server/bartender will know.  &quot;Ancient Bartender Secret!&quot;|I&#039;m thinking 0 is a safe amount.  Never mix alcohol with anti-depressants.|don&#039;t chew watch the news... heath ledger died from mixing crap.......so i vote ZERO beers dude.....|Doctors  don&#039;t recommend drinking alcohol with celexa or citalopram but I did and nothing bad happened to me.. be warned though you will get drunk &amp; fall asleep early.. i DO NOT reccomend it xx  BTW non alcoholic beer  is safe as it doesn&#039;t contain alcohol xx|Mixing drugs and alcohol is never safe. Stick to non-alcoholic beers and you will be fine.|Probably none. Even one beer could cause a bad reaction. Your life is all that is on the line. I mean blacking out is one thing(common when mixing booze &amp; anti-depressants) but death??! So not worth it pal|There is no safe ammount.|Don&#039;t listen to these P.C. people There is nothing wrong with drinking beer with antidepressants. I do it all the time and I don&#039;t limit myself any differently than before I was taking them.
Can you get a high off celexa and xanax?|6|my friend told me if i take 2 of the .5 mg xanax, and a 20mg celexa i could get high off it, is this true?? im not planning on doing it i just wanna know the truth. and also if you don&#039;t get high off it what are the effects?|Depending on your tolerance to the Xanax you can get high off of it, but you cant get high off of celexa, its an anti depressant, all it will make you do is be dependant on it and very depressed when it isnt in your system (i took celexa for 3 years). I actually was wondering the same thing, im used to the xanax BARS and i have the circular pills and was wondering the conversion ratio. but seriously. dont start doing that **** man.|i was talking about the circular pills by the way                          Report Abuse|ahh dont do all of that! i took one xanax bar and i got sooo ****** up.  when u take a xanax bar you dont feel any different but the next morning i remembered bits a pieces.  there were some things i had nooo memory of.  honestly i would advise not doing xanax.  it ****** me up perminatly.  i really wish i could go back and never have done it.  now i can&#039;t remember things that happen in my every day life.  you may be thinking oh that won&#039;t happen to me im just going to take it once.  trust me i only did it twice and took one bar each time i did it.|yes you can get high off of the medication if you have other brain disorders. No, please don&#039;t do it, because it can have major effects on your brain. The effects vary from person to person and age to age.|wow, i take celexa and that never occured to me! i have no idea
How do you change from Lexapro to Celexa?|3|Is 40 of Celexa the same as 10 of Lexapro?  Thanks.|What ever your doctor says, lexapro is not for everyone but is said to be 3 times at potent so 10mg of lexapro is about the same as 30 mg of celexa. This is what i was told.|See a doctor before you try this.  They will probably want to taper you off the Lexapro before you start the Celexa.
How likely is it that I will have delayed ejaculation will on Celexa?|5|I have been prescribed Celexa and have heard about some of the side effects. The one that I would benefit from would be the delayed ejaculation.(hint hint) Lately I have turned into a minute man and have tried all those special techniques that have left me disapointed...so what is the likelyhood i will get delayed ejaculation and how fast do the side effects kick in?|As you probably know, Celexa is in the same class of meds as Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil. These meds are well-known for having negative effects on a person&#039;s libido and general interest in sex. On the positive side, in some cases one can keep up (no pun intended) an interest in sex and no longer be bothered by delayed ejaculation. Most likely, it depends on the dosage of Celexa. Too much Celexa and you may lose interest in sex. Not enough Celexa and you may ejaculate too soon. So you would have to find a dosage in the middle.  Positive effects of Celexa for depression usually take 3-6 weeks to kick in---sometimes as long as 8 weeks. Delayed ejaculation would (for some people) be considered a negative side effect. These negative effects can kick in in the first few weeks of taking Celexa. That would be good news for you. I&#039;m sorry the language in my answer was kind of blunt, but I answered your question in the best way I could.|You can get the percentage of men who have this side effect by reading the clinical trial data usually available from the manufacturer&#039;s website--sorry I don&#039;t know off the top of my head, but it isn&#039;t as great as you might think. The reason for the delay is because of difficulty maintaining an erection. You will only get half way up and it will be hard to keep focused and you will go soft constantly. That is not going to please a woman.|I can&#039;t have an orgasm at all while on antidepressants. It seems that side effect kicks in within a couple days.  I didn&#039;t take celexa, though, but this was true for prozac, zoloft, paxil, pristiq(effexor), and another one I forget the name of.|it depends
Is it safe to take Excedrin Migraine while taking regular doses of Citalopram/Celexa?|2|I have been on Celexa for about 2 months now, and I was curious if it is safe to take Excedrin Migraine. I usually take a double dose of Excedrin and was also wondering if this would be okay? Please, only respond if you have a good idea of what you&#039;re talking about. I have searched the Internet but haven&#039;t been able to find much. Thanks!|Don&#039;t ask that question online. Call any Pharmacy and ask the Pharmacist. They will all answer your question over the phone. Pharmacist spend around 40% of their time correcting doctors errors in prescriptions that could be deadly. It probably is ok but check with someone trained in answering that kind of questions. We voted and don&#039;t want you to die yet. hehe.                                     8~)
What happens when you mix Celexa and Alcohol?|2|Thirty Celexa and some shots of vodka? What can I expect?|Let me put it this way:  Don&#039;t do it!!  Lynn
Can Celexa make you feel disconnected or kind of like your drunk?|2|I have been taking celexa for at least 6 months now and I was at 20 mg and I was having horrible headaches all the time and feeling really spacious or like I was drunk or disconnected. Pretty much like my sense arent as clear as they should be. And I got rid of the headaches by dropping down to 10 mg but I still feel that funny drunk feeling and I was wondering if its from the Celexa or if its from something else. And if it is from the Celexa do i really need to be on it.|Well if your doctor strongly recommends you for celexa I suppose your just gonna have to toughen it out but if you don&#039;t I would say change to something else ..I know it can be quite difficult  but when I was on it I had headaches and sort of a drunk feeling too...what i did was just rest alot(I wasn&#039;t sleeping much at the time, so this may be your problem too), had alot of water and generally just tried to be healthier...these didn&#039;t cure it completely but I didn&#039;t feel as if things were as out of focus as much and for most of the times I didn&#039;t feel drunk at all but occasionally the drunk feelings would come back.
My doctor prescribed me celexa anyone have an opinion on it?|5|My doctor prescribed me celexa anyone have an opinion on it?  I had bad size effects when I was on Zoloft what should I expect when it comes to side effects for celexa?|it might cause nausea if you ever miss a dose.  If you stay on 10 mg things might be less than with 20 mgI loved it but recently switched bc of sexual side effects.  But that doesnt mean it will happen to you.  All AD&#039;s can cause side effects...some more than others.Besides the inability to have orgasms....I LOVED Celexa|I don&#039;t know anything about celexa, but my son is on efexor.  He has gained a great deal of weight, foggy head and no sex drive.  We are still in the process of trying to find the right doseage to suit him|You should have the information in the box it came in an it will tell you about the side effects.|Might take 2-3 weeks to take affect.  Adult dose is 20-40 mg.  As with any medication there are a ton of side affects.Main thing is if you start feeling suicidal discontinue and get help.
I was taking the max amount of Celexa during my pregnancy &amp; I miscarried could the medicine have caused it?|9|I was almost three months pregnant when I found out I had a miscarriage the other day.  Very depressed about it my husband &amp; I are trying to find out if Celexa could have caused it.  I have two other children &amp; while pregnant with them I never took anything &amp; they are healthy children.  What do you think?  Do you think it could have caused my miscarriage?|I have heard that Celexa can cause miscarriages. I am soo sorry that this happened. You should talk to your doctor about maybe being put on something different if you try to get pregnant again. Good luck.|The loss of a baby is absolutely devastating. Support each other as much as possible through this sad time. I have researched Celexa and have found some information for you: In studies involving Celexa and pregnancy, the antidepressant was shown to cause miscarriages and birth defects when it was given to pregnant rats. However, it can still be given to a pregnant woman if her healthcare provider believes that the benefits outweigh any possible risks to the unborn child. So, it may or may not have caused it.I was offered drugs for my anxiety/panic disorder. I said I would try other alternatives such as Cognitive behavior therapy, as my mother (Who is a midwife) said that you should go off them to reduce any risk of harm to the baby, and I hope to have children in the future, and didn&#039;t want to come off drugs for it and risk myself being scared/fearful and have panic attacks. Im dealing with it naturally. It would be very different with depression of course, im sure there are therapies that would help you too like it did for me.Please, don&#039;t feel guilty about this, you dont&#039; know that it was the cause, try for another baby and ease yourself off Celexa for the next pregnancy.|I can&#039;t tell you if the medication caused the miscarriage, but I can tell you that you shouldn&#039;t trust the medical industry when it comes to fetal safety.  These anti depressants have not been around long enough to have definate research on the side effects.  My friend took anti psychotics and prozac while pregnant, her doc said it was fine.  Baby turned out ok, but I sometimes feel that her child has some mental issues as well. could just be genetic though. If you get pregnant again, just take the safe route and stay off any medications.  excercise will keep your mood lifted while pregnant.  Watch &quot;The Business of Being Born&quot; it will give you a good idea about just how little the doctors know about pregnancy and medications!|Anything is possible but I don&#039;t think it caused it.Sometimes the body is just not ready to have another baby.I&#039;m glad your other two are healthy and I&#039;m sorry about the loss of this one.have you spoke to the doctor that put you on Celexa to see if he knows of anyone else who has miss-carried while on it?|It could, or could not have. You&#039;ll probably never know. I know that nothing I say will make you feel better, but you realize that the miscarriage may have been for a reason? Maybe taking that medication while trying to build a baby had a harmful effect on baby, and your body knew that the baby wasn&#039;t ok in there... so your body did what it knew it should do.Sorry for your loss.|There is a good chance.  Some medicine are so strong that the fetus can&#039;t handle it.  Remember, everything you consume your child consumes as well.  This is why pregnant women can only take low dose tylenol and no aspirin (and only with the doctors okay).If this concerns you, I would talk to your doctor.  Maybe she will give you better insight.|I know a woman who takes Celexa and has miscarried twice in the past year. Seriously, I think there is something to this. I don&#039;t think the doctors have researched it enough to even know.I&#039;m sorry to hear about what happened.|your doc wouldnt of prescribed it, i dont think that was it
If I stop Celexa after only one dose, will I experience any side effects of withdrawal?|4|I was prescribed Celexa and took my first and only dose this morning at 1 am.  I hate the way I feel and would like to try something else.  Do I have to worry about any possible side effects if I stop now, since the drug is barely in my system?|No but you need to go back ASAP to the doctor who prescribed it and find out what you should take.  And tell him why you stopped it|I don&#039;t suggest you stop Celexa after only one dose. Actually, the initial taking of any mental meds can make you &quot;hate the way I feel &quot;.I suggest you continue for a month, and see how you feel then.Good luck. Any more question, email me at qinggong165@tom.com or jiayunfei155@yahoo.com.cn I am in China|No  but you could look on line and see what the side effects are, alot of times when you start a new med you can have normal side effects that will go away. Talk to you pharmacist or MD.
Is it safe to just stop Lexapro and replace it with Celexa immediately?|6|My doctor didn’t mention it as a problem so I’m hoping it’s not an issue. I’m switching from Lexapro to Celexa. Is it safe to just stop Lexapro and replace it with Celexa immediately?|I agree with Elle that Celexa and Lexapro are basically the same drug.  It may be trickier to switch from one class of drug (for example, an SSRI like Prozac or Lexapro) to another class of drug (for example, an SNRI like Effexor). Also, people generally have trouble getting off Effexor. The transition from Lexapro to Celexa should be quite easy. If not, keep track of any side effects and report them to your doctor. Also remember that many side effects last only a few days to a few weeks.|If your doctor didn&#039;t recommend to wean you off of it then you should be fine. It&#039;s not usually safe to quit psychiatric meds cold turkey, but since you&#039;re under the care of a doctor then it&#039;s no big deal. Just make sure to call them if you notice any major changes.Edit: What I mean by cold turkey is you&#039;re not lowering the dose and tapering off of it, simply stopping. Even if you are switching to a different medication you&#039;re still stopping the Lexapro. However, as I said, since your doctor knows what&#039;s going on you don&#039;t need to worry.|Well they are pretty much the same thing, one is just a more &quot;pure&quot; form I guess you could say.  Celexa contains both active and inactive isomers whereas Lexapro contains only active isomers.  This has almost no effect on the therapeutic mechanism of the drug.  The drug company made Lexapro when the patent on celexa started running out so they they could still make a ton of money off of it.  You are basically taking the same drug.|See www.theroadback.org on Lexapro (notorious). Few doctors know about weaning off (not taught). Page Z.22, in section 2, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris has a detailed method, suitable for Lexapro. See page R, while you are there. I suggest that once you have slowly tapered to 50%, you could begin low dose Celexa, building up, as the Lexapro is reduced, but even this is not without risk.Check out medications at:  http://www.drugs.com * &amp; http://www.iguard.org/ &amp; http://www.rxlist.com/ &amp; http://crazymeds.us/ &amp; http://www.askapatient.com/  Use the medication interaction function, here*.|It should be fine as long as thats what the dr recommended.

Anyone have problems with both drowsyness and insomnia while on Celexa?|4|I&#039;ve only been taking Celexa for 2 days now. I tried it in the day first and was drowsy all day. Today, I took it before bed and now I can only sleep about 3 hours and I&#039;m up and feel a little drowsy but can&#039;t fall back to sleep.|Insomnia can be a side effect of Celexa, but the side effects should start to wane as your body adjusts to the medication.  After the first week you will most likely start to feel better, and by two to three weeks any side effects should have passed.Stick with them and give them a chance to work their magic.|i had side affects to other anti depressent drugs, so i went off them. but then i tried celexa and i had no side affetcs.|everyone has different side effects. ive been on it for like 2 months and at first i was really tired but then my body adjusted to it.

Sometimes it takes trial and error with anti-depressants, you may have to try another.  And another.  And another.  Until you find something that works.

It took maybe a litttle over a month but I got 0 withdrawal. I felt a bit low once or twice but it was nothing major and remember when u feel low when coming off an ssri just keep thinking that your brain has to get used to the drug being gone and u will feel normal real soon.

With this type of drug, the dosage may need adjusted.  Also, talk to your friends and family, see if they have noticed a difference in you.

Is this a normal side effect for the medicine celexa?|4|Asking for someone else.Is this a normal side effect of Celexa to have itchy watery eyes and itchy runny nose and sneezing a lot?This isn&#039;t an allergic reaction is it?|celexa can cause rhinitis  (5% vs. 3%), sinusitis (3% vs. &lt;1%)the % are the actual % of patients who took the medication vs the placebo effect or those patients that were given a sugar or neutral pill but thought were taking the actual medication.

I have been taking Celexa for a few years and this hasn&#039;t happened to me.  Are you sure it isn&#039;t just seasonal allergies?  I live in the Northeast and it is fall allergy time so maybe it is just a coincidence.  If it were an allergic reaction you would probably develop a rash as well.  In any event, you should contact your doctor to be sure.

What pecentage of patients on Celexa gain weight?|2|I don&#039;t care if I gain 5 lbs but, I would be upset if I put on 25 lbs. How common is weight gain on Celexa. I&#039;m on 20 mg right now?|No one can determine what weight you will gain as medication reacts differently on each person. Celexa will add weight to some and others it will not affect. It will just have to wait and see. Sorry! Wish you the best of luck. Please consider though, that you were put on that medication for a reason, the benefits should out weigh the risk. Celexa is a very good medication for depression,OCD, and anxiety.
Is blurry vision a side effect from Celexa?|4|I&#039;m supposed to be on 40 mg of Celexa but everytime I try to take it, even quartering the pill down to 10 mg, I get horrible visual side effects.

My son&#039;s rheumatologist questioned the use of this drug with my son because &quot;it lowers the seizure threshold.&quot; I didn&#039;t see visual disturbance on the side effects.

I&#039;m hoping something natural will work better too. Not entirely satisfied with the effectiveness of Celexa. Tried Wellbutrin &amp; it made me worse. Any info would help.|A doctor would be the only one qualified to answer that question. Whenever you&#039;re trying to wean yourself off of a drug and onto something else, you run into several potential problems (some of which could possibly be deadly). There&#039;s withdrawal of the previous drug, interaction concerns, having too much or too little support at any given time, etc, etc.A doctor can at least help warn you of the possible problems to watch out for, help recommend the best dosages to take and when to decrease/increase the dose of each, and several other factors to make the transition as easy as possible for you and your body.|both work very well.You might want to discuss coming off celexa gradually with your doctor, and if there are any contraindications for mixing celexa and st. john&#039;s wort or SAMe.  Doctors do have access to a Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) for herbal interactions with prescription drugs,There is probably no contraindication to using these two substances, but it is best to check with your doctor first.
What is the difference between Celexa and Lexpro?|4|Please don&#039;t cut and paste the answer from another website. Thank you.|They&#039;re both antidepressants that sometimes people take for other things such as anxiety.  They have the same active molecule.  Celexa was made first.  Then the makers of CeLEXA made LEXApro.  Oooh they&#039;re so creative with names, lol.The only difference between the two chemcially is this...Think about your hands.  They&#039;re exactly the same but also exact opposites, right?  So your lefthand glove won&#039;t fit onto your right hand.  Well Celexa&#039;s active molecule is just like your hands.  Half of the molecules are shaped in one direction, and the other half in the other direction.  Now picture all the receptors in your brain that it&#039;s supposed to bind up with as all left gloves.  It&#039;s the extra right hands floating around in your system that causes some of the side effects of Celexa.With Lexapro they took the active molecule in Celexa and got rid of the &quot;right hands.&quot;  So one, yes it&#039;s more potent.  A lower dosage will do just as well as a higher dosage of Celexa.  But there&#039;s also nothing left of the active molecule to cause side effects.  There&#039;s still a risk of some, but much less than with Celexa.Okay, that&#039;s all I got.  Hope it&#039;s what you were looking for.|Celexa - Base drug Citalpram - Citalopram is used for the management of depression . It also has been tested in persons with obsessive-compulsive disis an antidepressant drug used to treat depression associated with mood disorders and panic disorders. Lexapro Base drug Escitalopram is also and anti-depressant drug. Both are in the class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRI).Lexapro is a more potent SSRI than Celexa and is better tolerated in the treatment of both depression and anxiety. In a study of patients with moderate to severe depression 47% of patients who did not respond to Celexa treatment responded to treatment with Lexapro.So Lexapro is better drug for the above treatement. -|10 dollars

Is a dose of 40mg of Celexa equivalent to 20mg of Lexapro?|2|If you answer this, please state whether you are a patient or a practitioner.|Yes (almost). The Celexa is a relatively selective medication that is made-up of an equal mixture of left and right-handed molecules called citralopram. The left-handed molecule is the one that works its effect. When you purify it further and remove all the right-handed molecules you get  escitralopram (or s-citralopram) which is Lexapro. The Lexapro is then slightly more effective than the double amount of Celexa because the right handed molecules are not getting in the way.Old Doc

Anyone experience weight loss or gain from takn celexa?|5|I take 20 mg citalopram(celexa) everyday n i actually at first thought i was gainin weight but i seen my doc after being on it for 2 weeks and i lost a few pounds, so i was just wondern if anyone else experiences weight loss or gain. I know everyone is different. Any replies would be greatly appreciated!|I have taken Celexa for 2 years lost loads of weight am now under weight and can&#039;t put it back on so yes! It&#039;s a common side effect the doc tells me (weight loss or gain) probably more to do with my anxiety tho, I reckon! E-mail me if you wanna chat about that particular drug. I take 40Mg&#039;s a day!!|I have been on it for a month and haven&#039;t noticed any weight gain, although I do have the munchies for sweets.|don&#039;t worry you won&#039;t gain weight since this medication side effect is anxiety.  try taking it at night if you are feeling anxious during the day, this helps.|Sweets,That&#039;s a good one the answer is yes. I took Celexa a long time and did not loose or gain, but any of these type drugs usually cause you to gain weight. Except, Prozac I lost weight on it. I took it for a long time but now am on Lexapro which is Celexa reinvented. I have gained weight but I&#039;m also not active and much older than you. As long as you stay active eat right and exercise I think you will do good. If your Doc does not give you good answers get a new one. They know if these drugs cause loss or weight gain. Just reed your enclosed information that comes with or look it up on the net!
How long does it usually take Celexa to take effect?|3|I just started 3 days ago for post partum depression. I feel a little better today, but I don&#039;t know if the drug would have time to do it&#039;s thing in just 3 days...|a few weeks, or sometimes not at all.Post-partum depression is caused by a lack of the hormone progesterone. I don&#039;t know why your doctor would give you drugs  instead of simply re-balancing your body.You might want to get a second opinion or see a reproductive endocrinologist of your OB?GYN or GP is just into the whole &quot;drug&quot; thing.|You won&#039;t see the full effect of the medication until you have been on this medication for a good 4-6 weeks. Moderate effects in maybe 1-2 weeks.
If you stop Celexa do you get severe depression?|4|I have ran out of celexa for about a week now and for about four days had dangerous depression. I am trying to figure out if that is celexa causing that or if i am just losing my mind.|Stopping any SSRI cold turkey is going to lead to problems, depression being one of them.  If you have depression, and it&#039;s being controlled by celexa, when you stop celexa.....YOU&#039;RE GOING TO GET DEPRESSED.Call your doc, get a script filled, get back on it, go to therapy, help yourself get better.|If the Celexa is controlling your depression then stopping it will allow it to return. The best thing to do is let your doctor or psychiatrist know about it.|Yikes!  That can be really uncomfortable for you, physically!  You should get in touch with your doctor and tell him/her what&#039;s going on.
How long do I need to wait for Celexa to be totally out of my system ?|2|so I can see what my other medications are doing?  i took 20mg for 4 weeks then 30 mg for 2 weeks then tapered off to 20 for 4-5 days then 10 for 6 days.  now i haven&#039;t had any for 6 days.|The half-life of Celexa is 35 hours.  We normally use 7-9 half-lives to calculate 99.9% of a drug to be eliminated from the body.  So in this case it will take approx. 280 hours or about 11 days to be eliminated.
Do you know of any women that have taken Celexa throughout pregnancy and child birth?|4|What has been your experience? Have you heard of any problems occurring? I have heard of possible side effects occurring during the child&#039;s withdrawal period. What do you think? I am personally against drugs all together but there is the fear of postpartum depression so in a way its a &quot;catch-22&quot;.I know that the issue is somewhat controversial and some &quot;drug-pushing&quot; doctors will state various other facts. I am looking for the real answer in this case. Hopefully someone neutral. If you have had any experience with this please answer if you can. Thanks.|One of my best friends is pregnant and she was on Celexa.  The doctor took her off of it when she found out she was pregnant and prescribed Zoloft instead.  His rationale was there are not a lot of studies that show the effects of Celexa on a pregnant woman.  He also said he will keep a close eye on her for post partum depression, and prescribe something accordingly.|most SSRI&#039;s are categorized as class C depending on the semester...but celexa especially is categorized as Class C which means that reproductive harm has been shown in animals but no studies done on humans - its generally a hard call but both sides have to be weighed..|This new study says baby should be o.k.: http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070112/hl_n...

My doctor is switching me from Celexa to Lexapro?|7|Cause I was having very vivid dreams on celexa. Do you find lexapro better then celexa? Did you get any bad side effects switching meds or being on lexapro?|I am On Celexa now.  It is working better for me than many i have tried.  I have to admit.. that now being on it for over 6 months.. i am now having very almost real dreams..  Like you said... Vivid..... They haven&#039;t really bothered me though... Not yet anyways...        I have however had really bad luck with Lexapro in the past.  I had weird  almost  high feeling when i went on it..  I felt like i was walking on pillows..  That feeling lasted a week..  I couldn&#039;t work.. and didn&#039;t want to drive...  So my doctor took me off of it.   That may not happen to you.. It couldn&#039;t hurt to try..   There are many kinds to try.. it just takes awhile to find the one that works best for you...  I wish you luck. Take care.|I took lexapro and it didn&#039;t help with depression.  Plus I had sexual side effects (no orgasms).  But that problem went away once I stopped taking that medication and switched to Abilify 10 mg.|I have to say i did not have much success with lexapro. nothing bad but nothing changed either. it was like i was taking the meds for nothing. I agree with one of the others , it never hurts to try , these meds affect everyone differently. I recently was put on Effexor XR...I loved it I was doing so much better, except I seem to be allergic to it. I would break out itching like crazy within 30 mins of taking it. So I told my doc, and we are taking me off the efexor  and trying Cymbalta.  Good luck I hope you find the one that works for you !|I have been on lexapro, it&#039;s good, it makes you feel very normal, almost as if you aren&#039;t taking medicin, but you dont feel depressed.|go for celexa its the bestu need to try itgo for itokdoctor is rightu just take his adviehe is rightu go for celexA|See www.drugs.com &amp; http://crazymeds.us &amp; www.theroadback.org (Lexapro). It&#039;s your life: your decision. I&#039;d seek a second opinion, but I&#039;d never be taking them in the first place! ANXIETY: See anxiety treatments, at  ezy build (below) in section 6. Set yourself a fixed limit for worrying about any particular subject, (say; 10, or 15 minutes) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to even consider that subject again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. Use the technique for reprogramming negative thoughts and internal monologue (self talk), on pages 2, and 2L, to help you in this: some people carry a wide rubber band in their pocket: put it on their wrist; stretch, and release, as a means of reinforcing it, and speeding up the process, re-pocketing it afterwards, but I regard this as being purely optional. Practice one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53,  and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at  http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: &quot;Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself.&quot;  ~~~  LOW COST/FREE COUNSELLING: Contact your county/local mental health agency, and find out what help they can offer. Psychological counselling, with a sliding scale, based on income, is available through many religious organisations, such as Catholic counselling, the Methodist church, and the Unitarian Universalists. You don&#039;t have to be a member.              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                      DEPRESSION:  My standard post follows, but, if you are young, antidepressants are unsuitable for young people.   See depression treatments, at ezy build, below, in section 2, and consult a doctor, to eliminate thyroid problems, etc. as possible contributing factors: also seek a referral to a therapist using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy. It is your decision, and yours alone, as to whether to take any antidepressants offered, but, before you do, read section 1, and check medications out at www.drugs.com so you will be on the lookout for side effects, like sexual dysfunction. My strong recommendation, however, is to follow the advice of my doctor, his associate, and also Marcelle Pick, OB/GYN NP, and  Dr. Mercola,  at www.mercola.com and many others: avoid antidepressants (pages 2V, and 2Z refer, &amp; antidepressant websites: page 2). The reasons why we all share the same view on this are explained in full, as you will find, if you read the whole section. All of their advice, (except prayer, because many people are not religious) I have incorporated into the &quot;core treatments&quot;, including occupational therapy, relaxation techniques, and exercise, with others as options, such as the supplements: Inositol, or SAMe, or herbal remedies, like St. John&#039;s wort. If you are diagnosed with clinical (major) depression, antidepressants may be necessary for a while, which will give the treatments time to become effective. The antidepressants themselves need at least several days, or even  weeks to begin becoming effective. It&#039;s a good idea to taper off them slowly, with medical advice, after  several months, say, to a couple of years, at most, because they are only effective in the long term for about 30% of people. Because of this, you would be well advised to begin the treatments immediately, and maintain them. I&#039;d just thank your mental health care provider, and pocket the prescription, trying the treatments for a few months, to see if they are sufficient for you, before considering filling it (unless clinically depressed, and having great difficulty functioning, or suicidal, in which case I&#039;d take them).                                                                                                                If the amount of daylight you have been exposed to recently has reduced, perhaps due to the change of seasons, see Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) in section 2, at  http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris and, instead of taking 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily; replace 2 of them with cod liver oil supplements for the winter months only! (or, as probably a better alternative to the 2 cod liver oil supplements: 1 teaspoonful of cod liver oil, with a little butter, to ensure its use; I take mine on sourdough rye bread, or toast, covered with fishpaste, and pepper, to mask the strong taste).  Consider having your doctor test your vitamin D levels, using the 25 Hydroxyvitamin D test. Optimal levels are 50 - 55 ng/ml (115 - 125 nmol/l. It should be above 32 ng/ml. Those people who receive adequate exposure to sunlight, daily, won&#039;t need the vitamin D from cod liver oil, but many people, particularly those in latitudes far from the equator, find this difficult, to achieve.
Anyone else on Celexa suffering also with hypoglycemia?|2|I am wondering if the hypoglycemia is related to the celexa, I have been on it for many many years now but thinking maybe its playing a role in it and is affecting my body now.|SSRI&#039;s can cause hypoglycemia due to a side effect of the medication which is decreased appetite.  Therefore, if you do have a decreased appetite, try and eat more complex carbohydrates like pasta, potatoes, whole grain breads, and bran cereals.  if that doesnt help, you may want to talk to your doctor about getting tested for hyperinsulinemia which is increased levels of insulin in your blood.
What is the highest dose that celexa is given in? How high can your doctor go with the dose?|2|I am currently taking 40 mg and have been on this dose for about 6 years.  It does not seem to be helping me anymore.|You need to contact your dr as you do not want to get the wrong advice and overdose.  That stuff is very dangerous and can kill you, if you overdose.  So, seek the advice of your dr before changing anything and continue to keep taking it the way your dr prescribed until then.
Can Viagra be used for impotence resulting as a side effect of Celexa?|2|I did some quick research, but didn&#039;t find much.  Has anyone had any experience with this?|Yes, it can. If you ever have a question about medicine interacting negatively, type both names of the medicine in google and if there are no warnings or newpaper articles or anything like that then it is generally safe. Since Viagra and Celexa both effect completely different parts of the brain, it should work just like taking Viagra with normal erectile disfunction.
Will the loud ringing in my ears stop if I quit taking Celexa?|2|I have already had problems with ringing in my ears before taking this medicine but now it&#039;s really loud and bothersome. It&#039;s so bad I have trouble falling asleep to white noise now. Something I could easily do before.I just want to know if I quit taking it if that side effect will stop.|Call your doctor, maybe this is a side effect.  If you can stop taking something, get rid of this noise, take something else maybe, then why not?
Has anyone who have tried Lexapro or Celexa experienced a side effect of diarrhea?|3|If so, is there another SSRI that you&#039;ve taken that doesnt have that side effect?|i was taking Celexa, and yes, i experienced that side effect also.|I take Lexapro and don&#039;t have that problem.
Can the side effects of celexa change like this?|2|I&#039;ve been taking celexa 20mg for about 3 weeks now and in the morning. It used to make me very drowsy and helped me sleep at night. But for some reason last night I coudlnt sleep and it felt like it was keeping me up. Is it possible for the side effects to change like that? Or could it be from something else?|Sometimes things can do the opposite of what they are known for, such as anti-depressants causing suicidal tendencies and sleeping pills keeping people awake. If the Celexa is helping you manage your depression, then I don&#039;t recommend stopping the dosage. If it starts to interfere with your life, talk to your GP.
Any experiences with the prescription celexa?|5|I had a baby 5 weeks ago and have felt tons of anxiety and totally out of it. My doc gave me celexa and I am very scared to take it. Has anyone had any experiences with this drug?Thanks!|Funny you should mention Celexa.  My first cousin, age 48, just went through his second liver transplant,  has Hepatitis C., and has had cancer 3 times.  He&#039;s lost all motivation.   Last week his doctor figured he had to be depressed , which he admitted he was.  Today, after only 5 days on Celexa, the depression has lifted!!  We&#039;re all so excited.  So I would tell you; don&#039;t be afraid--be excited to take Celexa.  Your doctor chose that particular med for a reason.  You&#039;re going to feel so much better before you know it!! Don&#039;t be surprised if you lose a few pounds in the first couple weeks.  (I hope that makes you happy!)  Good luck, and enjoy your new little bundle of joy!! The Celexa will change your whole way of thinking.  You&#039;ll see!!  :)|hi.i started celexa when i was in 6th grade..a few years after my dad passed away. i took a few different ones before it, but i just got so sick from them. i then went on celexa and it was great. no side affects from it what so ever..i am now off of celexa.|I have taken Celexa (between 10 and 20 mg) for 7 years.It has no side effects on me that I am aware of and really helps my anxiety disorder (it runs in my family).  The only chemical it affects is serotonin (it keeps your own serotonin that you make naturally in your brain from being broken down too fast).  Of course, everyone is chemically different, but I&#039;m confident in telling you to at least try it for two weeks.  You might feel a whole LOT better, .like myself.  If not, there are other SSRI s that may help. (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors is the class of medication that Celexa belongs to) to try.My depression started with chronic anxiety, so don&#039;t be afraid if you need a little medication to get you through this challenging time.|Well I had really bad anxiety after the birth of my third child about 20 months ago and I was having a really hard time coping with everything my doctor put me on Zoloft then something else I cant remember what it was called but anyways none of them worked they seemed to work for about a coulple of weeks and then it would get way worse. So about 3 months ago he put me on Celexa and it has worked great I havent had any problems with it so I would go ahead and give it a try I know how hard it can be to deal with anxiety and coping with the stress of kids it can be very overwhelming.
Would super citrimax or L carnitine be ok to mix with Celexa?|2|I was drinking a drink with the first and had not heard of either so I googled them, citrimax is linked to increasing seretonin levels, and I know a lot of that stuff can&#039;t be mixed with celexa? I don&#039;t want any guesses, if anyone has some real facts and knowledge i would be very interested. Thanks.|try rxlist.com and drugs.com they have all you need to know about side effects and drug interactions take care good luck
Can I take melatonin with the nicotine patch, depakote and celexa?|4|I would like to take melatonin at night to help me sleep.  The nicotine patch is keeping me up.  Would it be ok to take the melatonin?  No sarcastic answers please.|Yes.~Dr. B.~|You can take Melatonin with nicotine patch, some patches can just be worn during the day, they may suit you better.|yep
Anyone have a bad experience coming off of celexa?|9|Did you quit celexa with no problem? Or did you experience anything bad coming off of it?|You need to wean yourself off Celexa slowly.  Even then, you may have some problems with dizziness and nausea.  My doctor suggested cutting the dose in half to start with, i.e take a pill every second day for 2 weeks.  Then after 2 weeks if you feel ok, go to every third day, and so on.  Please do not stop it cold turkey as you will feel pretty awful for awhile.  You should check with your doctor before doing this.  Often people with depression feel better so they decide to stop their medication completely without discussing it with their doctor.  This may be a bad idea as you may then become manic or extremely depressed.  Its always best to wean off a drug under your doctor&#039;s supervision.Good luck|I took two days to get off Celexa and feel horrible.  I got back on Paxil because it helped me in the past but my brain won&#039;t stop racing.

Grin and bear it I guess sorry|I&#039;ve never been on celexa but I have been on 30+ other psych meds. All I have to say is DO IT SLOWLY. I have experienced withdrawal with everything from Paxil to Zoloft to Klonopin.|At first I thought everything was cool, but the bright flashes started. They occur when you close your eyes,  you see a bright flash and you feel dizzy, and urine started to have a strong burnt rubber smell. Goodluck.|Stay off all prescription drugs...just look what the anti-depressants have done to your moms.|listen don&#039;t take any pills. do some research NOW !!
Is it safe to do a detox with clay when on klonopin and celexa or is this dangerous?|3|I&#039;ve been reading that calcium bentonite clay is the most effective detox available, however, I have panic disorder and I&#039;m wondering if anyone has experience with clay detox and panic attacks? I know my body needs to detox. Badly. But I&#039;m also afraid it might cause problems with my meds.|The detox can cause the drugs to be metabolized faster or not be metabolized.  Either way, it can change the drug amount you take daily and that can create withdrawals or toxicity.   I&#039;ve worked with people for two years who wanted off the drugs but had side effects.   I&#039;ve seen it happen all too often.|I&#039;m not a doctor, but I&#039;m an esthetician, I do body treatments and detoxes, and I&#039;ve had panic disorder and I&#039;ve taken those medications...I can&#039;t think of any contra-indications.  My only tiny concern would be too much klonopin while in a bath tub...but you probably know your tolerance and your functioning level.  I don&#039;t know if you will be doing a bath or wraps...if you are doing wraps, the klonopin would probably even help if your have claustrophobia anxieties.  As far as the rest of it, take the usual precautions and drink plenty of water before, during and after the treatment.  Add some lemon or cucumber to your water, and make it room temperature for extra benefits!  I think you&#039;ll love it!
Is there a point in time when celexa stops working?|4|I&#039;ve only been oon it for 5 weeks and it works great for my panic disorder, but ive heard it stops workin after 6 months?|Celexa is available in tablet and liquid forms. Take either formulation once a day, in the morning or evening, with or without food. Although your depression will begin to lift in 1 to 4 weeks, you should continue taking Celexa regularly. It takes several months for the medication to yield its full benefits.|Don&#039;t worry about it just now.You should be fine.|Get in touch with me sweets- I&#039;ve been taking celexa for 2 years. I recently went cold turkey on them as i was convinced they weren&#039;t working anymore. After a couple of days my head felt.......well really weird. After 10 days i put myself back on 10Mg&#039;s and i can&#039;t tell the difference now between before i took them, being on 40 mg&#039;s and being on 10 mg&#039;s!!
If i missed my last nights dose of Celexa should i wait untill tonight to take it?|6|also it seems to be making my anxiety worse....and will my klonipin i take caue depression?|Take the Celexa right now.  Take your usual dose tonight.  You won&#039;t overdose and you won&#039;t feel withdrawal either.Klonopin may cause depression is some people.  If you are taking the Klonopin for severe anxiety, it will probably just fight the anxiety and not bring you down.  Don&#039;t take too many.  It causes depression when you start taking more than you should and you become addicted to a high dosage.|I think that would be the best thing just take two when you do.... If you think that would be ok....|You need to take your Celexa as soon as you remember it.   Then you take your usual dose like you are suppose to.  You need to tell you Doctor about your increase in anxiety so he can help you.|Yes Get back on scheduel as soon as possible, if its perscription of course, any other thats just abuseing it. Klonipin wont cause depression, your over exagerateing, Take it easy and enjoy life.-Doctor Means|Forget about last night&#039;s dose - don&#039;t take two at one time.  Start all over tonight with the single dose and then keep your regular schedule.  Call your doctor and tell him how the meds make you feel as soon as his office opens, but don&#039;t stop taking them until you speak to a professional.
What time of should I take Celexa?|4|Have you found it is better to take Celexa in the morning or at night?|hi there, you must be starting the med.if you want start taking it at night so you won&#039;t be so drowsey during the day.once you get used to it, then it won&#039;t matter when you take it ........good luck|I want oust cream|Bedtime, it makes me tired
Would a low dose of Celexa cause weight gain?|4|I am considering taking 10 MGS of Celexa for GAD. I have taken others (at much higher doses and gained TONS weight).  I slowly tapered off of Zoloft (125 MGS) over the course of a month and it&#039;s been about a month since my last dose, and do not believe I need such large doses as I now also take anti-anxiety medication that has really helped (I resisted those for years).  Would a low dose of Celexa be a good augmenter without uncontrollable weight gain?  I&#039;m on 5 MGS right now, and want to go up to 10.  I won&#039;t take Lexapro because the dosing options are inflexible and I also don&#039;t have insurance.|First off, you should never dose your own SSRI&#039;s. Depression relapse and suicide are huge risks of doing this.Celexa, from everything I have read, does not cause weight gain. In controlled studies vs. Placebo, those on Celexa lost .5-1.0kg over those on Placebo.|i just got off celexa but was on it for almost 6 years and have not gained any weight.|Actually here&#039;s a question for you: is your doctor or you the one doing all of the tapering and experimenting here? Because I do know that Stress causes weight gain and this sounds like s stressful experience for you.  It has to be since you also stated you take an anti-anxiety.
How long does it take celexa to get out of your system?|2|I only took it for about a month and a half for anxiety.  I went on a weekend getaway and left them at home, didn&#039;t take them for 3 days, so I guess I stopped cold turkey.  How long does it take to get completely out of my system?|5-7 days with fliuds
Does Celexa cause erection difficulties in sex but not masterbation?|3|I can &quot;get it up&quot; myself but the two times I had (tried) to have sex on it, I could not get it up then. Is this from the meds or my premature ejaculation? If it is the meds, I am screwed because (by myself) I last 10 seconds off it but can get it up. On it I can last a lot longer but can&#039;t get it up during sex. It is also embarrassing either way and I am now afraid of sex. It is not a good thing for a 17 year old boy.|Dunno about Celexa, but celery... now THERE&#039;S a food to help get it up. Plus several others which have zinc and dark leafy green qualities to them.|If Celexa isn&#039;t working then you have a premature  ejaculation problem or erectile erection problem and need to see a doctor. Don&#039;t be embassed to discuss this problem with him as they have seen it before etc.
Does celexa cause weight gain or weight loss?|5|I keep flucuating between 128 and 132, was just wondering if anyone experinced loss or gain from taking celexa. I do eat healthy and excercise, i also have a active job that involves alot of walking.|hey sweets! i think we&#039;ve chatted about this before but just in case i take celexa 40mg&#039;s daily have done for 2 and half yrs.For me i found i lost weight i went from a healthy 65k to48k i am now 55k and struggle to to keep that weight on! I&#039;ve never been this low i have always, all my adult life been 60 to 70k|First, I dont believe pills &quot;Cause&quot; you to gain or lose weight.  However, Celexa  does cause an increased appetite, which if not watched will cause you to eat more and thus, gain weight.  As far as losing, that is all on your own.  My wife fluctuates in that same weight range regularly, without celexa.|I have been taking Celexa for about a year now, and have starting gaining only since taking this medication. I am debating on not refilling my prescripton.|I have been on Celexa for 3 years now &amp; I have gained weight. the doctors kept telling me that weight gain was a minimal side affect compared to Paxil, Prozac, etc..needless to say that I am not happy!!
My girlfriend is taking Celexa for anxiety attacks. Can she take birth control?|2|I looked all over the internet. She asked her doctor. He will get back get back to her.but I&#039;m just tired of waiting. Anyone have any ideas if she can take it or not?|Yes, it should be fine. From what I&#039;ve searched there&#039;s no real interactions. www.drugs.com has an interaction checker. However, I would try calling a pharmacist if your doctor hasn&#039;t responded. He or she would know.
Zoloft and Celexa stopped working for me?|8|I have been taking Zoloft and Celexa for a long time. Lately I do not feel that they are working. I am jittering and confused a lot of the time and unable to face life&#039;s problem or function like I used to. I have a short temper and get mad over dumb things.  I just want to be normal.|I will say talk to ur doctor n tell him how u feel he will work with u ...And see a psychologist n learn more about the diasese n urself|I was on zoloft and my doctor told me if I feel the meds arent working or i feel suicidal phone and make an appointment ASAP|maybe its time to upper your dose.  u&#039;ve been taking the same mg&#039;s for a long time it makes sense.|It sounds like you need a change in meds or dosage.  Your doctor might try something else like Lexapro and Xanax.  The only way to solve the problem, though, is to meet with your doctor.|have you been diagnosed with bipolar?  i know that irritability is a symptom of cycling when you have bipolar.and it&#039;s possible that the meds aren&#039;t helping anymore because you are cycling.|Tell your doctor.|Some people find that anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications stop working as well as they once did. It&#039;s very common. Could be a dosage adjustment might do the trick, but more likely you will want to try another SSRI. There are many of them, and they all have a different &quot;feel&quot;. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find one that will fit you, and you&#039;ll be feeling fine again soon.All the best.
Anyone take celexa? How long did it take before you felt a difference?|5|Did you like it? Did it make your weight change?|It started in a week and gradually improved for a month. I just noticed I wasn&#039;t all worried and obsessed anymore. It was like I could do what others could do - just &quot;not worry about it,&quot; which was once impossible for me.I didn&#039;t have any sexual side effects. If anything, it has made it possible for me to BE sexual, because I&#039;m not freaking out all the time.Yes, there was a tendency toward weight gain, but it&#039;s manageable. I craved sugar a lot when I got on Celexa. It was summer, and I wanted a Sprite every day, which I would normally never do. So, I just watch what I eat and it&#039;s OK. Everyone&#039;s different though.Hope it helps you!|I&#039;ve taken it for 7 years, I felt better in three days,but was told it could take as long as three weeks. my weight didn&#039;t change any, but it has sexual side effects, like not being  easily aroused and delayed orgasms|I am on a generic form of celexa.  I have been on it for about 6 months now.  It&#039;s really been helping a TON with my social anxieties.  I have gained weight... I really can only attribute it to the meds because not much else has changed.  I probably do need to change my habits tho! I do like the drug, it&#039;s probably been the best i&#039;ve ever been on (and I&#039;ve been shuffled around on many meds in the past 14 years...  starting at age 13 with prozac).|I take celexa now and have for about 4 years. It took about a week for it to begin to take effect. I feel great, and have started to taper off with mydoctors premission. I have not gained any weight as of yet. I may once I am off.
My dosage of Celexa was lowered from 20mg to 10mg, I have had nausea and lightheadedness, is this normal?|3|Anytime the dosage is adjusted can you have side effects like these?|Hi,Don&#039;t worry. It&#039;s common to experience symptoms like these when you slowly taper off of anti-depressants. With Celexa, these symptoms should go away within a few days (3-4). If they last any longer that that, then I suggest you go back to the psychiatrist who prescribed them to you and ask if you can do a slower taper (ie. drop to 15mg first, then to 10mg). Everyone responds differently to drugs and everyone reacts differently when a certain drug is withdrawn, particularly anti-depressants. Don&#039;t worry, what you are describing is a very common withdrawal symptom.Hope this helps and feel free to drop me a line if you need more help.|yes
What does celexa make you feel like?|2|I have just been prescribed celexa and am leary about taking it.I have mild panic attacks and depression on occassion. Does it put you in a good mood or do you not feel any effects?|It really depends upon the person. I take it, and so does my mother, and it has no negative side effects for us. However, it could for you, and the only way to find out is to try. It may take your body a week or two to get used to the medicine, so give it time. But report any dramatic changes to your doctor immediately. When you are on a regular celexa schedule, and suddenly don&#039;t take it for a week or more, it can make you feel naseous, but otherwise, you should be fine.
What are the effects on my body if i drink while taking celexa?|4|I;m meaning like a glass of wine tonight?|One glass might not have a bad side effect.... but you really shouldn&#039;t mix alcohol with medications. It could cause serious harm, which is why drugs carry a warning label about alcohol consumption.If you&#039;re planning on drinking anything with alcohol, perhaps you should just skip a dose of Celexa. Better to be safe than sorry.|BAD NEWS!  my sister did it and was so messed up she almost got raped.|it would amplify the effect of alcohol if you drink while on a SSRI.
What happens if you stop taking Celexa?|3|What happens to your body if you just stop taking celexa?|being an antidepressant, celexa is a long acting drug, and your body does become dependant upon it.  sudden cessation can cause seizure activity, bizarre mood swings and several different kinds of phyical symptoms such as muscle aches and joint pain to name a few.  It is never a good idea to just stop such a medication, talk to your doctor about a taper if you no longer wish to take it.|There are many reasons that all of the drug information says Do Not Stop Taking  this drug without consulting your doctor.  It should be something your doctor covered, as well as your pharmacist, and it should be on the prescription drug bottle.  All SSRIs can be dangerous to stop suddenly. In my personal experience, it could start off by causing a headache or dizziness.  Then it might lead to chills or light-headedness.  Then you may pass out, start vomiting, or get flu-like symptoms.  The time it takes between a missed dose and the start of the withdrawl symptoms is different for everyone.
For those of you who have taken Celexa or the generic has it made you really tired?|4|I have been taking 20 mg of Celexa generic  a day with 5 mg of Loraxepam a day and I have been sleeping 12 plus hours every day. Has anyone else had this combination? If so does it eventually get better were I am not always so tired? Have been taking for 2 weeks.|It is most likely that it is the ativan that is causing the lethargy, rather than the Celexa. You might want to talk to your doc about reducing your dose of lorazepam to see if that would do the trick.|yes and yes itll take about a month or 2 i was on those drugs for about 6 months then they switched lorazepam to clonazepam, and celexa to paxil.|it will make you real tired at first, if you start making unwise choices while on this medication, which for me came about a month into it, you need to stop taking it or slow your way off of it, pay attention to the warning lable, see your dr.
Can I drink alcohol while taking a low dose - 15 mg celexa for anxiety?|5|you shouldn&#039;t really but i don&#039;t think that one or two drinks every now and again will have bad effects on you. if you want to go for a night out then simply don&#039;t take your pills for that day.xx|go ahead and swell up like a balloon and fall asleep. Drinking alcohol makes you forget about anxiety so stop taking your medicine start drinking!|I would call the drug store and ask if the mixture is okay.Better safe than sorry.You can also type celexa in your web search, and getmore information.|No, you can&#039;t safely do that. There is a label right on your med that tells you not to drink alcohol with it. (or there should be!).|uh lemme think ....NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...not at all dont do it ...well accually im not sure ...haha srry ///
Is there anything that I need to be concerned with while taking Celexa?|6|I just started taking Celexa.  I have taken meds for this before but it has been a long time.  The Dr. that I had when I was younger said that my depression had gone away.  Now out of nowhere it has started again.  I am taking Celexa and I was just curious as to what are the most common things that you guys that are taking this have had to deal with.  Please let me know I am worried that I may get too tired to finish school work and take care of my daughter.|This is the first time I take an anti-depressant and I really like Celexa. First of all my doctor told me to take it at night because it would make me sleepy. I was previously taking Lunesta (sleep-aid) because I had trouble sleeping, but now that I have stopped Lunesta and started taking Celexa right before bed time, it helps me sleep. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend taking it in the day time. The first day after I took it for the first time, I had the yawning symptom. I was yawning all day long. It subsided a few days later. I also was a little nauseous the first few days, but after about 4 days, all my symptoms had subsided. Stick with it til at least a week and you&#039;ll feel better.I&#039;ve been on it now for 5 weeks, no symptoms and I feel a ton better. No more &quot;bad&quot;  thoughts in my head, no more depression. I started feeling better with 2 weeks of taking it.Good luck!|cymbalta is a much better drug. i have been on about 14 different ones over the last 12 yrs and it is the ONLY one that has helped me with very little side effects.|It can make you suicidal.  Or homocidal.  It can make you gain weight.  It can cause brain tumors.Stop this drug NOW!|All the different SSRIs have different side effects. Celexa is known to be a pretty decent SSRI, but may make you sleepy. If so, ask your MD about taking it at night.Side effects sort of differ with each person. Nervousness, chest pain, insomnia, stomachache-these are all pretty common when you first start taking a medication. Most of them go away within first week or two.If you have specific concerns, you could call a pharmacist or call your prescribing MD. Pharmacists are usually pretty knowledgeable about side effects, etc. The big concern that people mention is the &quot;suicidality,&quot; but if you go to the NIMH website, the data will show you that for children and adolescents, there was an increase from 2%-4% in suicidal thoughts and no suicides. In fact, since the black box warning went out for children and adolescents, the suicide rate has increased.Bottom line is, talk to your doctor if you start feeling weird or having side effects you think might be related to the drug.|Well, the big thing is that sometimes when you start a drug for depression, your symptoms can initially get worse - to the point that you consider suicide.  That&#039;s something you cannot ignore.  Not a reason to not take the meds - just something you should watch out for.  Yeah, Celexa made me light-headed and dizzy.  I had to switch to Lexapro and it works fine, however, I have anxiety issues rather than depression.  I should say, I HAD anxiety issues since the med. really stopped the problem.  Good luck, hon and be sure to tell your doctor if you have any side-effects that disrupt your daily life.  They can change or adjust your meds as I&#039;m sure you know...
My daughter is trying to and wanting to cut herself again on 2 40mgs of Celexa per day.  do we need worry?|9|She cut her toe nails this morning until they bled. Is this something that goes with the Celexa? She was on 1 40mg , then on 1&amp;1/2 40mg, and now on 2  40mgs oper day. before that she was on Paxil. Would she need to go back on Paxil?|If the anti-depressants are stimulating self-injury, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders, or any indication of her becoming MORE depressed: you should probably try a different medication.Prescripting anti-depressants to minors ALWAYS has the major risk of developing MDD (major depressive disorder) and the risk of suicide. Please talk to her doctor and try switching back, or trying, a different anti-depressant that works.All medicines react differently to different people. What works for one person might not work for the other.Good luck, and God bless. :)[EDIT:] To the person who said that drugs do not cure cutting... while anti-depressants might not CURE cutting, they can drastically lower the chances. For many people, cutting is a sign of depression; and without depression, there is not a frequent amount of cutting.Of course she should still continue therapy. However, if this drug is making her do it, she should not be on it.|Medication is sadly not a cure all for every non societally accepted behavior. It has been proven that drugs alone are not as effective as a combination of therapy and medication together. The fact that your daughter is wanting to cut herself is a big indicator that she is struggling with something internally or externally depending upon the reasons for her behaviorsMany cutters use this as an way to express feeling and emotions (such as stress)  when they feel numb and want to feel something, anything at all. Others use it as a from of punishment, when they may not feel they are good enough, can not cope with making mistakes, and or are unhappy with their appearance or it could be anything really.I would talk to your daughter and work together with her to determine what she wants to do about her desire to cut. I would ask her if she thought that therapy would help but do not force her because then she will feel like you are taking away her freedom of choice and retaliate against you and may never willingly seek help. Let her know that you love her and whatever that is bothering her you want to be there and support her through it, if she will let you. I hope this helps|Yes, it sounds like she is slipping.  Although someone said Celexa and Paxil are too similar to make a difference, that&#039;s not necessarily true.  Each SSRI is different.  Each person responds differently.  She may not be responding as well or responding differently.  The dose might not be right or a return to Paxil or another med may be needed.  In any case, tomorrow would be a good day for her to call her doctor.  And, yes, therapy is the cornerstone of getting beyond cutting.  Antidepressants alleviate the depression so that the underlying issues can be addressed.|There is not enough difference between those two drugs to believe that one will work better than the other. The warning about suicide is very real and makes me believe that the drugs are usless over all. your friendly pharmacist|please contact your daughter&#039;s physician. they are the only one who can correctly answer your questions.|No drugs won&#039;t help, she needs therapy and a couple of sessions will do her good. God Bless her and and GOOD LUCK|drugs DO NOT cure cutting she needs therapy to help her with that|she needs a therpist
Is it normal for my celexa to not last all day?|7|I just started taking celexa 5 days ago and i&#039;m starting to notice improvement. I take it in the morning but by the next morning i am starting to feel anxious. Is this normal and will it last?|It is going to take several weeks for you to feel the full benefits of celexa.The medication has to build up in the bloodstream.Continue taking.Don&#039;t miss a dose.Don&#039;t stop it suddenly and I promise you will feel better.|You started it FIVE days ago. You have to remember that anti-depressants are NOT that fast acting. I&#039;m sure you&#039;re probably noticing some improvement...but once the med is built up in your system (in 4-6 weeks), then I&#039;m sure that this &quot;not lasting&quot; will decrease and it will start lasting longer because it&#039;s all built up.Until then, don&#039;t worry. If you are uber super worried, call your doc and talk to him/her.|well celexa could be, right for you or not. but any thing that you know about your celexa, you suppose to talk to your doctor. cause sometime, you have to tell him or her cause. then they will know what to put you on the right stuff. :-)|Medications usually take a few weeks to get into your bloodstream and work on a controlled release.  I would give your medication about 4-6 weeks and if you still have these symptoms, then your doctor may need to raise your daily dose a few more milligrams.|Like everyone else said, you want to give it between 6-8 weeks to kick in.  Some doctors will also prescribe Celexa twice a day if you have problems with how long it lasts.|you will not feel the complete effects of celexa for up to 4 weeks. give it time and the dose can be increased once you have been on an adequate trial.
What are the side effects of discontinuing Celexa (citalopram) abruptly?|2|What can happen if you just stop taking this medication?|According to this website:Abrupt Discontinuation   After 8 weeks of treatment with Celexa, abrupt discontinuation of treatment caused a higher incidence of anxiety, emotional indifference, impaired concentration, headache, migraine, paresthesia, and tremor than was seen in patients who continued on Celexa. These symptoms are not indicative of addiction. Although it is not known whether gradual discontinuation will prevent the discontinuation symptoms, it is recommended that the dosage of Celexa should be tapered off over 1 to 2 weeks.
Can antidipressants such as zoloft, prozac, ritalin, wellbutrin, celexa be enhanced by alcohol or marijuana?|12|I&#039;ve read that alcohol can enhance the effects of psychological meds. How about marijuana?|I&#039;ll give ya personal experience answer.I take Wellbutrin and find that I&#039;m alright with a few. But on the couple of occasions I&#039;ve partied hard, I don&#039;t remember any of it. And not like the normal fuzzy drunk memories, like nothing.And I used to be able to drink the big boys under the table.All the warnings on the bottle say none. My doctor said a couple is ok, but I think it depends on the individuals health.|No.  Alcohol will just cancel the effects of the medication.You shouldn&#039;t drink alcohol and take antidepressants.  You can look up the side effects online.|All of these anti-depressants (except RITALIN, it is a stimulant) are not positively enhanced by alcohol or marijuana. They would lessen the effects of anti-depressants...|yes, alcohol but not marijuana|Yes, depending what you are on those drugs for sometimes you will get severe side effects , Not a good idea . A friend of mine takes wellbutrin and becomes very suicidal when she drinks . It all depends , but I would not mix those meds with drugs or alcohol.|I really don&#039;t like this question, since I think you may use the answer to improperly use medications.  Every one of those meds state on the side not to combine with alcohol.  They don&#039;t say anything about marijuana.  Go to the manufacturer&#039;s website and ask them.TX Momnot an expert|ummm,anna nicoles son found out what happens if u &quot;enhance&quot; antidepressants with anything!!!!!!!|It doesn&#039;t ENHANCE the effects but it can interact with the meds. Antidepressants are serious medications and you shouldn&#039;t be mixing alcohol or marijuana with them. Alcohol particularly can interact with antidepressants but not to enhance there effectiveness! Ritalin is not an antidepressant but is sometimes used for depression in those that have a hard time with fatigue or sleepiness. Ritalin is a stimulant. It also is a very serious medication that should not be mixed with alcohol or marijuana!! I hope that you are taking these as prescribed meds and not from other sources. As a nurse, I see many young people have reactions and/or abuse these meds with poor outcomes. Please.... think wisely|One of the best, all natural, treatments for chronic depression is the healing herb, cannabis. Cannabis has been used to treat a variety of ailments including acute, chronic depression for thousands of years. Countless studies have demonstrated its efficacy to relieve depression especially where standard treatments have proven ineffective.Get informed. Get active. All adults should have access to this beneficial medicine.|ABSOLUTELY. And alcohol and marijuana might well counter the effects of the antidepressant. If you want them to work, I suggest you don&#039;t over do it on party nights. Rather, don&#039;t take your pill on party nights. But every time you do that you&#039;re setting yourself back.|I&#039;m not sure what you mean by &quot;enhanced&quot;, but it&#039;s NEVER a good idea to mix drugs, especially when you consider that the manner in which most anti-depressants &quot;work&quot; is a mystery. The drug companies DO NOT UNDERSTAND what, if any positive effect these drugs have on your brain because they have never proven what they do!!
If you take celexa in the morning will the trouble sleeping effect go away by bed time?|3|Will the side effect of trouble sleeping go away if i took it about 14 hours before sleep? (morning)|Yes, try taking it in AM for several days to see if you adjust to it for sleeping.you can also speak with your MD about a sleep med if it doesn&#039;t help.Try drinking chamomile tea or tea with Valerian Root, Hops, Catnip.You can also try Dramamine or Benedryl for sleep.Good luck.|I used to take Celexa at bedtime and experienced the same thing. The problem is, I&#039;ve always had insomnia, so I don&#039;t know if it was from the celexa. My doctor told me to always take it in the morning to lessen the side effect. I do sleep better now. Give it a few days and see if taking it in the morning helps. If not, you need may to find another medication.
Has anyone ever drank while taking celexa?|4|i just started taking celexa and i bartend for a living so am around alcohol quite frequently....i usually drink once or twice a week heavily....have you drank on these meds and been o.k?|They don&#039;t recommend it but I did and nothing happened to me.. be warned though you will get drunk &amp; fall asleep early.. i DO NOT reccomend it xx|You shouldn&#039;t be drinking alcohol with any anti-depressant.  It should state that in the info that came with your prescription.|I was on Celexa when I was in college and did not experience any negative side effects when drinking. I can&#039;t say I would recommend it, as the manufacturer clearly advises against it. But I consumed alcohol on many many occasions without suffering any consequences.
Is loss of appetite normal with Celexa?|2|I&#039;ve been on Celexa for about 4 days, and I&#039;ve noticed that I barely eat anymore. Normally, I eat a lot, especially at lunch, but today I had a half piece of ham and a bite of cheese. Is this normal?|I wish,That&#039;s interesting, if there was a pill that CAUSED loss of appetite, the overweight people would run out the door to buy it!
Is celexa a good effective antidepressant?|3|my psychiatrist just put me on celexa for my GAD OCD and depression.....i&#039;ve heard that its an ok medication and that lexapro is better (my boyfriend takes lexapro). because its a newer more effective version of celexa. Has anybody heard of or had any good exeperiences with it?|Lexapro is similar to Celexa, it&#039;s just a purer form of it. Everyone reacts differently, and unfortunately the only way to know if Celexa will work well for you is to try it. Many people find Lexapro works better or has less side effects, but others find the opposite true.I have neutral or bad experiences on all SSRIs, but I know people that Celexa has worked really well for. It took me several years of trying meds to find ones that worked well without bad side effects. Try it out for 4-6 weeks and see how you feel, if it doesn&#039;t seem to be working ask your doctor to try something else.http://www.crazymeds.us/celexa.htmlhttp://www.crazymeds.us/Cipralex.shtml|i heard they were both thesame..........xanax is awhole lot better
I have celexa, seroquel, and klonopins but i was wondering if its ok to take them togther?|3|thanks  to everyone who responded to this question.|YESCelexa..anti-depressantseroquel...mood stabilizer..makes you very sleepy thoughklonipin...anti-anxietyBut..Be careful...the meds. have many adverse reactions and should be prescribed particularly for one person.  GL|If your doctor perscribed them for you, the yes you can take them. But if you got them anywhere else, you should never take medications without a perscribtion from your doctor.
Celexa????|3|I am on 20 mg celexa.  I smoked a small amount of marijuana about 7 hours ago. Is it okay to take my pill now?|Celexa is an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety med.  You aren&#039;t supposed to take any depressants while on it if you want it to work. (alcohol, pot, etc.)|I take 40 mg of celexa and have for years, helps greatly. You should not mix any drugs that your doctor does not prescribe.Celexa is a potent drug, check in a PDR or a pill book to make sure that the THC in your weed will mix. You could ask your doctor. If this sounds stupid then you do not have an honest doctor/patient relationship. Celexa works on chemicals in yourbrain, so does THC. Think of what your doing to your brain. You can&#039;t get a replacement.
Has anyone ever taken celexa for mild depression and anxiety?|3|Just wondering if anyone has taken celexa for anxiety especiaally gad and ocd.How did you find it I have been taken it for a week and so far I only have one minor symton,and could anyone tell me if its easy to get back off them.|I was on celexa for quite some time..It took a full month to feel the full effects..It worked great..I will tell you, if you decide to get off of it, take it slowly ! your head will spin and you will feel like a complete nut if you come off it too quickly|I was on Celexa for quite awhile until I switched to Effexor. If you plan on stopping them, you need to talk to a doctor to talk about a gradual decrease as they can have some major side effects if you quit taking them abruptly. to my knowledge and in talking with my doctor it takes work to get off of them, you really have to be in the right mind set and be willing to learn how to refocus your thoughts. I have been on some form of anti-anxiety meds for 6 years and don&#039;t plan on quitting anytime soon. The help is there and I am going to take it -- but that is me.
Celexa users: are your dreams 3D, ultra vivid and as real as real gets, for a dream?|2|I am simply amazed at the complexity and in depth dreams I have since taking Celexa a few years now.  Any of you experiencing this?The dreams seem like full length movies, and are superbly detailed.|I don&#039;t take medication but my dreams are like what you describe. Makes me look forward to sleep particularly when I have an erotic dream.
How has Celexa (citalopram) worked for you?|6|I have been taking it for three days now and I&#039;m just curious to hear how others have experienced this anti-depressant. How has it helped your depression? Has it helped or diminished your cognition in any way? Responses to these kind of questions are pretty much what I&#039;m looking for, but any further details or feedback in regards this medication would also be much appreciated. Thanks|I took this for about 6 weeks and it made no difference it actually made me feel a little worse , however, I am being treated for anxiety as well as severe depression so bit different to just simple depression. My cognition was not affected by citalopram, I didn&#039;t really suffer side effects except it making the anxiety worse. I know quite a few people who have been on it and there are mixed results those with quite severe depression didn&#039;t find it too useful but moderate depression and anxiety related disorders have found it very useful at calming some of the anxious symptoms and getting through the day with no effects on cognitive ability. It takes a couple of weeks to work at the least though.|It stopped me having panic attacks, but didn;t get rid of the general, free floating anxiety although it did reduce it a little.  I&#039;m not sure about the depression though, I felt less depressed, but then I didn&#039;t feel good either - it dulled all my emotions, and I stopped giving a damn about anything, I didn&#039;t care about anything or the people close to me.  The people close to me felt they didn&#039;t know me any more when I was taking it, and thats why I stopped.|Celexa is HORRIBLE!!!! I HATED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought it was aweful!!! It made me feel worse!!!!!! I stop taking it as soon as it made me feel that way, and a year later got on zoloft, my doctor said that people that dont do well on celexa do well on zoloft, and it makes me feel great, helps my anxiety too!!! I love it!!!! But really, it all depends on your brain chemistry and what works for you, so see how you feel in a few weeks-month, and if its not good, I suggest zoloft!|I took it for depression and anxiety for about 8 months.It didn&#039;t really do anything for my depression, but it took the edge off my anxiety. After about 6 months it stopped doing anything at all for me though.|Never heard of it till now,however it has helped (thank you very much) i can now spell it.
What kind of side effects did you have with celexa?|2|I just started yesterday and so far ive just been a bit nauseous and last night i felt high and then past out and slept through the whole night for the first time in months. no dry mouth like i had on effexor which is goodI am really concerned about the sexual stuff mostly will i still be able to orgasm|Look at www.after-cancer.com which is all about drug side effects and things to do to that help.Good luck.Verite R
I&#039;m switching from Cymbalta to Celexa for anxiety?  Has anyone else done the same?|4|The Cymbalta was working but is just too expensive.  I&#039;m leary of starting the Celexa because if it doesn&#039;t work, then I&#039;ll have to switch again.|I suffer from major depression with a &quot;side order&quot; of anxiety. I ain&#039;t no doctor, but over the years I have learned a bit about psychiatric meds. If Cymbalta works for you, I suggest trying to stay on it (using the info below). Cymbalta works on serotonin and norepinephrine, while Celexa works only on serotonin. There are no guarantees in the wild, wacky world of psychiatry, but Cymbalta might be a better med for you, especially since you say it is working. Almost all drug companies have patient assistance programs to help people who can&#039;t pay for their meds. Some companies make it quite easy to get free or cheap meds, while others make you fill out many forms and send lots of documentation. Check out the link about Cymbalta.http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cym...If this program does not apply to you, maybe Celexa will work just fine. You can also ask your MD about Buspar, which is for anxiety. By the way, I hope you are seeing a psychiatrist rather than a regular MD, for your psych meds. Be well.EDIT: Be wary of those who say a certain psych med is excellent or fantastic. We all respond differently to psych meds. If someone responds well to Celexa, it may not mean that you will. I&#039;m sorry if this is bad news for you.|I know that everyone responds differently to antidepressants and I certainly had my share of trials and many of them twice.It&#039;s interesting that your doctor selected Celexa.  There is a newer version of Celexa called &quot; Lexapro&quot;.  Basically the same drug, but with less side effects.There are so many to try.  Hang in there and I hope you find one that works for you.|Well, I think you are making a good move.Celexa is nearly identical to Lexapro, wich is a FANTASTIC anti depressant and goverment approved for Anxiety. It really works, u will feel the effects ina few days. Don&#039;t be scared. Take it at night, too, it will help calm u and u will sleep better.
How to manage sexual side effects of celexa?|4|I am a 20 year old male, started taking celexa about 2 1/2 weeks ago. I used to have a pretty good sex drive, but now its almost completely gone. i was just wondering if anyone else experienced these types of effects, and if so, how did you manage it? did you switch to a new medication? or can you take somehting along with celexa to negate the effects?if you stopped completely, how long did it take you to regain your sex drive?|Well, whatever you do, don&#039;t stop suddenly or without consulting the prescribing doc.I take Lexapro, which has a similar side-effect.  My shrink recommended I take Ginko Biloba supplements to help.  You might want to try the same; they&#039;re available over the counter with other herbs and &quot;alternative&quot; medicines.|I know a lot of medications for mental illnesses have warnings about sexual side-effects; and of course it doesn&#039;t affect EVERYONE one..but it&#039;s possible. It is normal for your sex-drive to be decreased if the medicine (or doctor) told you the side-effects. If it is burdening you to the extreme, then talk to your doctor about trying another medication, but don&#039;t risk your mental health for a lower sex drive, it&#039;s not worth it. I&#039;m sure there are many natural remedies a doctor or a health shop can help you with to boost your libido. It also could be from reasons aside from the medication - maybe whatever reason you are taking the medication (ie. depression etc) may be affecting your sex drive.All you can really do is go to the doctor about it - or try some natural medicines (as long as they don&#039;t interact with the celexa)|One of the side effects of antidepressants are sexual side effects.  Are you disinterested in sexual activity or are you unable to acheive/maintain wood?If the issue is wood, see your doc about some viagra or cialis.  Or, you could try another antidepressant.If your issue is disinterest, do it anyway, its good for what ails you.
Has anyone switched from celexa to cymbalta for pain relief of fibromyalgia?|6|I am in the process of switching from 40mgs of celexa to cymbalta. Just wondering if there are any withdrawal symptoms in the process and if cymbalta really helps with fibromyalgia pain. How long does the process take?|I work in health-care. I have had patients switched from celexa to cymbalta and they say they do better with cymbalta. It helps with their depression and pain from neuropathy. No side effects noticed.|I have been on celexa for 4 years now.  They don&#039;t seem to want to try anything different....An aside to Doc.  They use anti-depressants to block the nerve receptors in the brain.|I to have fibromyalgia but i take elavilmy doctor is trying me on that.Do the topsof your hands and feet burn just ceriouseto know.Eleil just make me sleep.So if yourswicted medication work and help you with painplease let me know so i can tell my doctor aboutit.Thank you|You can actually just switch over.  I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for awhile for my depression.  Doesn&#039;t seem to be doing to good for that but have not had as much fibro pain since taking it.|Those medications are antidepressants, not pain relievers.
What are the side effects of taking xanax with celexa?|3|Is there a risk of combining these two drugs Xanax and Celexa?|The two are not contraindicated (you can safely take them together).~Dr. B.~|IF your Doctor prescribed them  to you, then I would think it would be  okay.  For some reason, I get the impression that you are asking because you may be getting them from a different source.  If that is the case it isn&#039;t a good idea to take or mix anything unless a practicing Physician gives them to you.  What might be okay for one person, may not be okay for another.
Has anyone ever taken celexa for mild depression and anxiety?|3|Just wondering if anyone has taken celexa for anxiety especiaally gad and ocd.How did you find it I have been taken it for a week and so far I only have one minor symton,and could anyone tell me if its easy to get back off them.|Hi!  I had taken Celexa when my Lexapro stopped working (they&#039;re sister medications).  It actually worked great for about a month...then I began having manic episodes and didn&#039;t know what was going on.  When I went to the doctor again he explained that Lexapro is basically Celexa without all the side effects...Celexa has many side effects, including manic episodes.  I was taking it for depression/anxiety but I just couldn&#039;t stay on it.  The Lexapro worked wonders but it just stopped working after a while.Now, I know quite a few people who were on Celexa without any problems...just be sure to stay intune with yourself, your moods, and your thoughts.  If you begin to think there&#039;s a problem, there&#039;s nothing wrong with calling up the doc.Good Luck!|I`m taking Celexa and i find it wonderful.I used to take Paxil and it really messed with me, i had a lot of side effects and asked for a change.My doctor then prescribed Celexa.I went to get my pills and the pharmacist talked with me and she told me Celexa is a drug that works only with one nerv compared to Paxil that works with 2 , and i should feel ok with it.So far i haven`t had any side effects, it might be because my serotone is already messed up because of the Paxil.Whats the concentration you are taking?If it`s 20mg then it should be pretty easy to get back off them, if it`s more than your doctor will have to de-increase the dose until you get to 20mg.All in one i think no drug that messes with your serotone is good, but we live in a world where we make us believe it helps us getting better.
Has anyone had weird dreams on 20 mgs of Celexa?|5|Ever since my dosage was upped from 10mg to 20mg I have been having weird dreams anyone else having weird dreams on it too? My last weird dream was Paul McCartney bringing his daughter to one of my kids&#039; b-day parties. Weird huh?|Lol, that&#039;s a funny dream. But anyways, back to your question I&#039;m not on Celexa but I&#039;ve been on other medications which greatly affect my dreams. I&#039;m not sure exaclty why they do this, but I know that it isn&#039;t harmful in anyway but it can be kind of annoying. Try to deal with it the best you can but if it is somehow a problem in the future, you could talk to your doctor about it. Good luck!|Just search the web, the side effects listed do not include weird dreams.Would suggest you check the web to obtain more complete information in regards to side effects, and drug interactionJusr enter the word Celexa, and click web search.|The side effect isnt listed as one, but my psychiatrist told me that it might happen due to the fact that I was on another different anti depressant immediatly before.  My dreams were only slightly weird, I guess because Im used to having weird dreams.  Thought this might help you.|LOLNo, Celexa did not give me any interesting dreams.  I always get really weird dreams around &#039;that time of the month&#039;, though, and also when I take almost any kind of allergy medicine. :P
Looking for personal experiences people had with Celexa?|5|Can anyone whose taken Celexa PLEASE let me know how it worked for them, any side effects, either good or bad.I just started today, 20mgs, today and i know nothing about it.Ive heard some say they gained a lot of weight and were tiredthen others say they lost weight and were very hyper and restless!Go Figure,right!!!!HAHA!PLEASE let me know your expereincesThanks|well...i had a bad experience with celexa, they started me on 20mg last friday, i hated it, i couldnt eat or sleep and it made me groggy, bad dreams and very irritable....with me suicidal thoughts worsen and monday night i had a dream i was suppose to take the whole bottle and i did, 26 pills at once, went back to sleep and from what the doctors told me i had antihistamine and advil in my urine, which i dont remember, the pills had givin me amnesia and barely remember this past week...i went to the hospital and side effects from OD can last a week to a month.....i dont know how others feel about this drug, but dont hesitate to tell someone if u have suicidal thoughts...it was the most worst experience i had ever had, now they are putting me on wellbutrin... =/|First and foremost, read the literature that comes with your perscription. It will explain everything.  Then be aware of how you feel while taking it.  If you notice anything abnormal  simply call your DR. and repoort it. HE WILL THEN ADVISE YOU WHAT TO DO.  If you have not been given the literature,  Contact your pharmacist and one will be printed out for you.  Hope I helped.|I took it for a year before my doctor switched me to Paxil.  It made me dizzy but other than that nothing much.  Look it up and check to see the side effect so you&#039;ll know what to look for.|WORKS PRETTY GOOD FOR ME, I NO LONGER WANT TO SHOOT PEOPLE AND TELL GOD THAT THEY DIED!!!....LOL
Does anyone take Celexa- if so are the side-effects bad?|3|I am currently on prozac, but I feel like I have lost all of my mental clarity and am walking around with my head in the clouds! Also, I have no sex drive. My doctor recommended Celexa- what is your experience with this drug?|I didn&#039;t take Celexa, but I did take Lexapro for a couple of years - it&#039;s an isomer of the drug in Celexa (basically, they&#039;re very similar drugs, same chemical composition, just slightly different structures.)  Prozac did nothing for me (and Effexor XR was awful, but that&#039;s another story), but Lexapro did lift my depression a little bit to where I could get through the day, which gave me the mental clarity and ability to battle other issues (anorexia, self-injury) a little better.  HOWEVER.  Keep in mind that everyone reacts a little differently to medications, and that you should never base your possible response to a drug on what other people have experienced.  Best thing to do is talk to your doctor and if s/he recommends switching, give it a try.  You have nothing to lose, and it just might make things much better.  Good luck. :-)|This is pretty normal for any medications...I was in your same situation and tried everything to restore it.  I switched pills a couple times and gave up, the libido was just not coming back.  I then found a natural herbal enhancer that is supposed to increase your sex drive and a couple other things.  It&#039;s called Hersolution gel, read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time.  However it&#039;s like an instant libido rush and as I kept using it my sex drive was through the roof and continues to be.  The sensation blast is great too, I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve had multiple orgasms when before I couldn&#039;t even get a single one.  Theres also capsules you can take that I&#039;ve heard are better but I don&#039;t like swallowing many pills throughout the day.  I was skeptical at first but the return policy was so great that the company was offer.  From what I remember you had to try it out for a couple months but then you had time afterwards to return it for a full money back if it didn&#039;t work.  I didn&#039;t have that problem as you can see.  Well good luck and I hope this helps.
Has anyone gained weight from taking celexa?|4|i just started on it and im always hungry! Food tastes so good, now, and i am not prego!|I&#039;ve never heard of that one, but I was on Paxil for two years and gained a lot of weight. The doctor prescribed Topomax, which is a per scribed for seizures, migraines, and several other things. He gave this to me as a means to lose weight. It worked, but I stopped taking it. I&#039;m on Zoloft again, and have gained a lot of the weight back... sometimes I don&#039;t know if these depression drugs are worth all the damn side effects...|Im pretty sure i had a friend who took that, and she didnt gain weight but she had massive hair growth.|I have been taking Celexa for about 2 weeks, and I have not noticed a change in my appetite. I also have not noticed a change in my mood!! I hope it begins to work soon.
What have been your experiences on celexa?|2|and how many mg were u taking?|Immediately I had a headache after taken Celexa. It decreased my appetite which resulted in weight loss. It was fairly benefical for a few months, it suddenly stopped working after a while. I took 1 pill then 2. I found it better on the 1 pill.
If I quit celexa cold turkey and now a month later my blood pressure is up.. can it cause that?|5|I know you should not quit anti depressants cold turkey like that but I was out. I still am. Now I have to deal with high blood pressure and depression. When I was on it, my bp was pretty low, but not to low.|dont worry... be happy|I would check with your doctor.  It could be that stress is causing your blood pressure to go up.  If you are any cold medicine, the antihistamine can cause it to go up.  I took Celexa for 30 days and began to get a lot of bruises, so my doctor said I didn&#039;t need it.  His nurse practitioner gave it to me when I had to have a physical and I cried.  My mother had recently died at the time.  My doctor said I didn&#039;t need it to begin with.  I don&#039;t know how long you were on it.  I don&#039;t believe it is the reason.  Please check with your doctor.  I pray you have a healthy and prosperous New Year.|Control your blood pressure and any other problem.|You are going through withdrawals. Ask your doctor if he/she has any samples so that you can SLOWLY stop taking the drug, this will make the withdrawal process much easier.
Is Celexa making things worse for me?|8|Hello. I have been taking Celexa for a couple of weeks now, and I&#039;m actually feeling MORE depressed. Does this sound normal? I don&#039;t have another appointment until 12/7, and I think I might ask about trying something different. Anyone have any similar experiences? Thanks!|Yes.  Often anti-depressants make things worse for people that do not truly need them, or if they are given the wrong one.  However, some take up to 2 - 7 weeks to work.Do not stop taking it abruptly.  Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors cannot be stopped abruptly.  That&#039;s why its usually not a good idea to ask for medical advice here, as a couple of respondents told you to just stop taking it.You need to ween yourself off slowly.  Besides 12/7 is only a few days away.  Voice your concerns then.|The pill may not be working fully yet, it takes about a month for the drug to really even out in your system.  Call your doctor tomorrow morning and tell them what you said here in your question.  Your dose could be too strong, or this may not be the best medication for you.  I personally took Effexor after my mom died and it worked very well for me.|The Celexa might be making your depression worse.  I&#039;d be sure to see the doctor as soon as you can.|I think, I think you are supposed to  stop taking it if it worsens|Talk to your doctor about it for sure.

Could Celexa be making my eyelashes fall out?|8|I started taking Celexa 1 week ago and I&#039;ve suddenly been noticing my eyelashes falling out, when I rub my eyes or wake in the morning and they&#039;re on my cheek. Not lots and lots but 2 or more a day (that I see) I know we always shed our hair and lashes, but do you think it could be the medication, or I&#039;m just noticing it more what always happens, or I&#039;m paranoid, and looking for something to be wrong?|Tough question. I have very dry skin and dry eyes, nose and mouth - I am also on Celexa. I know the dry mouth and eyes are because of the Celexa and another drug I take, but it may also have to do with the weather - depending on where you live. I have allergies, and when I rub my eyes  because they itch or because they are dry - then I lose more lashes. Also, the dry winter weather doesn&#039;t help.If you wear makeup frequently, it could be a result of the makeup type you are wearing or what you use to remove it. Try making your eyes more moist with drops, and your lashes more supple with something like Vaseline. Just rub a tiny bit into the lashes before bed.I don&#039;t think the Celexa is making your eye lashes fall out directly, but maybe as a side effect of dryness.|always contact your doctor about any concerns.My best friend had a side effect that was not even listed on the &quot; side effects section &quot; so you never know!!!|Often bizarre side effects come with Celexa and other SSRI usage|no i took celexa and nuthin happened to me plus i have very long lashses for a guy but if ur really concered ask the doc that presciped them its not a stupid question|some medicines have been known to make hair fall out--I looked up the side effect profile and this is the lst of most frequent adverse reactions...from MEDSCAPE.COMDecreased Sexual Function, Disorder of Ejaculation, Drowsy, Erectile Dysfunction, Insomnia, Libido Changes, Nausea, Xerostomia (dry mouth).I think you are safe with the celexa, you are shedding...|I.D.K what that is|Eyelashes Fall Out All The Time!!
Is it normal to feel nausiated when first staring celexa?|3|just started today and cant seem to get this sick feeling out of my stomach also very restless and cant seem to fall asleep....is this normal?|I felt exactly the same when i was taking citalopram, but I think that you should report these symptoms to your doctor and they will tell you whether they need to change your tablets or dose.|Oh man, I feel your pain. I took Celexa a few years ago, and continued for about a year. I was seriously nauseated every day. I always thought I was going to throw up. I stopped taking it on my own and it made me extremely dizzy to get off it, but after a few weeks it stopped. My doctor asked me if I wanted to start it again just recently and I said NO WAY! I told him how sick it made me feel and he said &quot;Yeah, thats the trade off...&quot; I feel really bad for you because I know how you feel. Feeling sick is horrible, but its just as bad as feeling depressed or anxious. To me, the feeling sick to my stomach just made me more anxious and depressed... I might give it a few days, but if it doesn&#039;t get better you should see about switching to something else before your body gets use to it. If you feel like its helping with your depression, thats one thing, but for me it just seemed to make things worse. I hope you figure it out!
Have you or anyone you know taken Welbutrin or Celexa and had suicidal thoughts or committed suicide?|7|Its VERY important, please answer only seriously!|Yes; a girl I met in the psych ward had been put on Celexa and had become suicidal. Rarely will someone actually commit suicide on one of these drugs, but when starting on one, it is VERY important to begin on a small dose. Some signs you can watch out for are restless legs, bouts of anger and crying spells. These are indications that the medication is not compatible with your chemistry, and that you should taper off it and call a doctor right away before it becomes an emergency.|I&#039;ve been taking both of these, and I&#039;ve never had any adverse reactions to them.I&#039;ve stopped the Celexa, but I&#039;ve been on Wellbutrin for several years, and have no side effects. It&#039;s a pretty safe drug, and is used a lot for people who are quitting smoking, I hear.If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, do not delay reporting this to your doctor. If you know of anyone who has thoughts of hurting themselves, ask them to go to their doctor for an evaluation. If they delay or refuse, report them at once. This is not the time to be fair or respectful of things told in confidence. DO IT NOW!!!Talk to whoever is working with this person, but if you don&#039;t know who that is, and they won&#039;t tell you, this is an emergency. Call your local mental health clinic if possible, but if you can&#039;t do anything else, call 911 and give them all the information.If they curse you out and swear they&#039;ll never talk to you again, at least they&#039;ll still be alive.If you do nothing and they kill themselves, you will never forgive yourself. And if it becomes known to relatives, they could take you to court. If I were in their shoes and a relative of mine had died when somebody knew there was a problem and did nothing, I sure would!|Yes. When I was 17, I was very depressed, and they put me on Wellbutrin and Neurontin, a mood stabilizer.  I got increasingly violent and suicidal to the point of scaring my friends and family.   I was a &quot;normal&quot; depressed person when I got off, but I still sought help for my depression. I checked out some homeopathic medicine, and Aurum was very, very helpful. I didn&#039;t even have to be on it for long. Look up alternative medicines- they can really work well. Good luck ~ Adrienne|Yes.Akathisia is the biggest danger - this side-effect can be lethal. Watch out for an increase in motor restlessness, and internal torture the likes of which you would not believe. People can kill themselves simply to escape the effects. That&#039;s why the drugs have a Black Box warning - the highest possible warning - and information sheets for patients, specifically outlining the effects they must be very aware of/their families must monitor them for.|I&#039;m on Celexa and I haven&#039;t had any suicidal thoughts..|i committed suicide on them pills. this is the ghost of me. reread your question before you hit send

Anyone with social anxiety disorder have sucess with Celexa (Citalopram) as treatment?|3|I started taking it about a week ago, my doc upped my dose to 20 mg today. Seemed to have helped the anxiety a pretty good deal, tonight. Looking forward to even better results.|That&#039;s great. Celexa didn&#039;t work for me. Lexapro is the only thing I have found that really helps me. Its just a newer version of Celexa.|I took it also. But my system is sensitive.Along with my Diabetes meds, my intestineswouldn&#039;t allow me to sleep. My amount was 10mg.So he changed me over to Lovox.I don&#039;t think he knows what he is doing. Maybe atfirst you see some results, then your body getsuse to them. Then more and more and more.
Anyone on Celexa how do you like it?|3|I recently got put on Celexa and I was just wondering how everyone else likes it and there expierences on it. How long does it take before you feel better/Does it make you feel worse? Are there any side effects? Loss of Appetite loss of sex drive weight gain/or loss naseua?Any bad expierences on it?|Hey, I&#039;ve gone through numerous SSRIs, trying to find one that alleviates my hard-to-treat depression. I finally tried Celexa and surprisingly it actually works for me. I don&#039;t know exactly how long it took for me to start feeling a difference but maybe a month? Thankfully I haven&#039;t experienced any adverse side effects from Celexa, so overall it&#039;s been a good fit for me. Hope it works as well for you as it does for me!|The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it&#039;s not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.comWhat I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  Well good luck and I hope this helps.
I was just put on Celexa (20 mg) for PPD, and am still having insomnia.  Does this go away?|2|I know insomnia can be one of the side effects, but this is part of the reason that I am depressed.  Any information or experiences with this medication would be appreciated!  Thanks.|...Ad, when are you taking the medicine.  Celexa can give you insomnia OR make you sleepy as a side effect.  If you are taking it in the morning but still not sleeping at night, try taking it at night.  If you take it at night and it&#039;s keeping you up, switch to mornings.  Ask your doctor about taking OTC Melatonin with the Celexa.  My doctor has had me on it for a long time.  It is not a drug, but a natural substance that tells our brains, it&#039;s time to go to sleep.  It does not make you drowsey the next day and is not addictive.Good luck getting some rest, I know that is hard with a new baby under the best circumstances.
How long does celexa stay in your system?|2|it&#039;s for this drug project i&#039;m doing and i need to know how long it would take for one 40mg pill of celexa to be totally out of your system?|from what I read about 3 days (80 hours)
Has anyone ever been on Celexa for depression?|4|Any side effects that bothered you or anything that you didn&#039;t like about it?|I am on the generic of Celexa - The only side effects were a little weight gain and tiredness. The tiredness went away within a week, and I would rather have a few extra pounds and be happy than be skinny and miserable. :) I love my Celexa - it changed my life!!!!|I was originally prescribed Celexa, then moved to the generic and I am now on something entirely different: this is because after some period of time many people will find that the antidepressant they are taking becomes less effective. The only problems I experienced, which is not uncommon if you educate yourself on the side effects of these types of medications, was weight gain and the typical sexual side effects (inability to orgasm or low sex drive). That is, until I was switched to the generic. The generic was not effective at all for me after taking the brand name for many years. I would recommend that anyone that will be switching to a generic or even a different antidepressant be closely monitored for behavioral changes until you know how it will effect you.|I&#039;m on celexa right now.I&#039;ve been on 5 other SSRI&#039;s, and this has been, by far the most effective. I havn&#039;t noticed any side-effect, which is definitely a plus :)Good luck with everything.
Has anyone taken Celexa while pregnant?|6|I take Celexa for severe anxiety and am considering getting pregnant.  However, from what I have read, it is usually not recommended that pregnant women take it after the 2nd trimester, and that it can cause seritonin withdrawls in the baby after it is born.Has anyone taken Celexa during a pregnancy? Has anyone taken Celexa while breastfeeding?  I am not trying to ask this question in lewe of a doctors advice- I am just looking to hear personal experiences of others before I try to get pregnant.|I haven&#039;t taken Celexa but I took Zoloft with my first baby. I ws also told it would cause seritonin withdrawls. They said she would be a very fussy baby. She almost never cried at all!!!I am pregnant again and I am on Wellbutrin this time. I have severe depression so it would be bad for me without it. I was also on Zoloft while breastfeeding. I wish I had better advise for you.|I was taking effexor when I first got prego. I slowly winged myself off by the 2nd month. Now, I get anxiety and such, but nothing like before. Its just something that you learn to deal with, and its not that bad. You dont want to harm your baby.|I was given Wellbutrin for my baby blues, and was told it was safe to nurse at the same time. It helped for the couple weeks I took it.Ask your OB what s/he suggests...|i was taking effexor xr when i got pregnant also for severe anxiety.my doctor wanted me off everything. it wasnt too bad i&#039;m 34 weeks pregnant now and am off my meds. havent had any panic attacks or anything like that.... i&#039;m hoping i wont even need to go back on anything after the baby comes.Good luck!!!!!!|No u should not be taken that while u are pregnant...I am studing for pharmacy tech and that was one of our lectures from last weeks ago!
What are withdrawal effects of Celexa?|3|I have been on it for 4 months. (20 mg)  Today is the second day I have missed it and will not be able to take any tommarrow b/c I cannot pick up my prescription until Thursday.  Do you think I will have any withdrawal effects from this?  I asked my pharmacist and he said no.  I want to quit taking them completely.  What is the best way?  Has anyone every stopped cold turkey?  My doctor said take half a pill for a week and then stop.  Do you think this would prevent withdraw effects?|My doctor also told me to split the pill in half for a week and then stop. I got horrible side effects (hot flashes, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, sensitivity to light, weakness) and went back to my doctor. She agreed to taper me off more slowly (rather than her initial &quot;Go from 20mg to 10mg for a week and then stop&quot;). Now I&#039;m on a plan to take 10mg for a week, then 5mg for a week, then 5mg every other day for a week, then stop. I&#039;ve developed a constant head pressure that I&#039;m worried might not go away. I&#039;ve been to doctors and they&#039;ve told me I don&#039;t have anything wrong (not even a sinus infection). If you can, taper off as slow as possible, because the head pressure thing is horrible.|I have stopped taking my Celexa for periods like this and I always had side effects.  The doctors warned me not to drop off suddenly, as the medicine is desgined to stay at an even level in the bloodstream.  Dropping off causes problems.  I become depressed, agitated, not able to think clearly, restless and I feel not like myself at all.  If you want to stop using Celexa, listen to your doctor and his tapering method.  You won&#039;t have any side effects then.Good luck!
Thinking of going off celexa been on it for many many many years?|5|first of all I have been on anti depressants well for about15 years, various ones.  I started celexa probably about 10 years ago not sure exactly the dates.  Anyways I am a little apprehensive, just wondering what I will be like off my meds, I am not taking it for depression but rather anxiety disorder.  Would like to try other avenues of treatment aside from drugs.  I realize I need to do this slowely any suggestions.|Hi: We have a similar history with psych meds. I have been on most of the SSRIs (except celexa) as well as other new and old antidepressants, plus mood stabilizers, etc.If you have been on celexa for about 10 years without success, it certainly seems like it is time to try another med or to move onto &quot;other avenues of treatment.&quot; There is just so much in alternative health for anxiety. The only trick is separating the wheat from the chaff, that is, finding out what works for you and what doesn&#039;t. When I think of anxiety on a physical level, my first thought concerns breathing. As a general rule, when people get anxious, they breathe shallowly, usually into their upper chest. When people are relaxed, they tend to breathe deep into their abdomen. At least for me, exercise is a great remedy for depression and anxiety. It is not the ultimate cure, but it has helped me a lot. Psychotherapy can help you to understand and let go of the emotional causes of your anxiety.  Plus there is alternative medicine including good nutrition, yoga, relaxation techniques (like meditation), herbs, etc. Again, the trick is to find out what works best for you. In terms of withdrawal, celexa has a fairly long half-life: 37 hours. After 37 hours, the med would continue to trickle out of your body for another 8 days approx. The link below has great info on how one person tapered off celexa. Of course, check with your doctor. If you have been on the med for 10 years, there is no rush to get off it quickly. It&#039;s better to go too slow than too quickly. Best wishes.http://depression.about.com/cs/citalopra...|I think it wouldn&#039;t be a good idea to stop your meds without talking to your doctor first. Discontinuation sickness (&#039;withdrawal) can occur when you abruptly stop your regimen. These include headaches, dizziness, nausea, resurgence of anxiety symptoms, just to name a few. The withdrawal symptoms can be worse than the condition the medication was initially treating. You need to be weaned off. If you want to try a non-medicinal route to treat your anxiety, talk to your doctor. And let them guide to you to wean you off gradually, if they recommend it. Behavior modification can be another route to treating anxiety disorders. Ask about it.|From my own experiece, you need to go off celexa very slow and under a doctor&#039;s direction.  I went off Paxil too quickly, and ended up having a panic attack.  The worst experience I ever had.  I also have anxiety and went off celexa and back on paxil.  It seemed to work better for me because I also have depression.  Please don&#039;t do this on your own.  Good luck|read on curezone.com about anxiety and see how other people withdrew from their medicationsgood luck
Celexa side effects and/or good experiences?|6|Has anyone on here been on Celexa? I&#039;ve just been prescribed it and I just took my first dose.Has anyone had any bad reactions to it? Or good experiences?|I&#039;ve been on Celexa for 6 years now and it&#039;s worked well. I haven&#039;t had any reactions to it. I hope it works for you too.|I lost my appetite on it.

What are your feelings about Celexa?|2|I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder that I&#039;ve had since I was a child.  I was just prescribed Celexa today.  What are your stories with it?  Are the side effects bad?  Did it really help?  Thanks!|A doctor put me on Celexca.  I had terrible side effects!Blurred vision, severe rash, thought I was hearing voices &amp; seeing ghosts, couldn&#039;t eat, couldn&#039;t sleep, anxiety &amp; so onI&#039;ve had bad experiences all around with anxiety/depression medicines.  What it has come down to for me is natural healingMeditation, vitamin/mineral therapy, exercise, no caffeine &amp; sugar (most of the time...ha ha)  Most of all...minimal stress as possible.  Past &amp; present stresses have so many people bogged down, that they forget to ...LIVE, LOVE &amp; LAUGH!!Check with your local drug store of other possible side effects, as well as other options to this medication.

How do Lexapro and Celexa compare?|4|Does anyone know the comparison between Lexapro and Celexa?  I have heard they are quite similar.  I am currently on the Lexapro, but it cost almost a hundred bucks a month.  The Celexa is much cheaper.  Does anyone know the comparison between the two?I have been searching the net some, and can&#039;t seem to find much info.  So if anyone can give me a link to do comparisons or something, that would be great.Thanks to all who answer.:)|Hi Tammy,What a great question for me to answer.  I started on Celexa in April &#039;01 and was on it until Feb of this year when I started Lexapro.  (mainly b/c my doc thought I had built up a tolerance to Celexa)  I actually have had great experiences on both meds, very little side effects when starting and even switching from one to the other.  (they are in the same family of drugs)  The one difference I did notice was that the Celexa worked more for my depression and I was still experiencing quite a bit of anxiety.  Now that I have switched to Lexapro, which is more for people with anxiety, it seems to have helped much more with the anxiety, as well as the depression.  I guess you could say the Lexapro is a great &quot;all around&quot; drug when it comes to both.  Other than that, I haven&#039;t noticed any other differences and of course each person is different!  Hope this helps and best of luck to you!|Lexapro is a lot better than Celexa. Celexa and Lexapro are anti-depresant. Lexapro has fewer side effects than Celexa. You should find a journal that talks about Celexa Vs. Lexapro. There are many journals out there that the reserachers do the comparasion bw the two.                          Report Abuse|Lexapro is an isomer of Celexa. They basically took the Celexa molecule and split it in half, keeping the left side which has the therapeutic benefits and discarding the right side which was responsible for most of the side effects. I have been on Lexapro for about five years with virtually no side effects. I tried Celexa six years ago and did experience side effects so, to me, they are not interchangeable. However, everyone is different and maybe you&#039;ll be OK on Celexa.The reason for the difference in price is that Celexa has a generic (citalopram) in the market, while Lexapro does not at this time. My insurance company is constantly trying to get me to switch to generic Celexa instead of Lexapro. They are very sneaky, telling me that it is essentially the same, but much cheaper. Well, it&#039;s not. At least not for me.Hope this helps. Good Luck.
Anyone take celexa? How long did it take before you felt a difference?|2|I took it, don&#039;t really remember, but it obviously didn&#039;t work or I&#039;d still be taking it.  No I didn&#039;t gain weight.TX Mom|My depression never responded to Celexa.  I took it for more than 6 months.  I was told that it takes 2-4 weeks to feel the full effects of anti-depressants.I have gained weight with every anti-depressant I have taken.Let your doctor know if you are unhappy with the results of the Celexa at this point and see if s/he has any suggestions for you.  You might not have given it enough time.Good luck.Jeanene
What side effects come from quitting Citalopram (Celexa) cold turkey?|3|I&#039;m on day 6 with no meds (was taking 40mg Citalopram) and I&#039;m wondering what effects this has had on other people.|I&#039;m on the same dosage right now. Why did you stop taking it? Stopping any medicine &quot;cold turkey&quot; is dangerous.|coming off citalopram by yourself is not advised. If you feel you don&#039;t need the tablets then you should speak to your gp/doctor who can then talk about cutting the dosage or taking you off the pills - were you being monitored by a doctor while on citalopram? What has he/she said about your progress? Do you feel better, less depressed or have you just decided you don&#039;t want to take pills anymore? I don&#039;t know about your paticular dosage but the side affects of coming off citalopram without doctor&#039;s orders are usually feeling depressed, teary or sad - like a bad mood swing. You really ought to discuss this with a healthcare professional.
Does anyone have any info to offer bout celexa?|5|I have been takn it now for 2 1/2 weeks for a panic/anxiety disorder, it seems to be helping somewhat, it makes my attacks milder , so i was wondering if anyone has or is takn it and how it works for them. Any info would be greatly appreciated!|Hola! I just recently started taking celexa for panic attacks and depressionI think it&#039;s going great for now, the only info that I can give you at this moment is to be careful about weight, anti-anxiety pills make you put on a little bit of weightbut that&#039;s not everybody (just saying what I heard)I find its been helping me a lot so far|Celexa is a good anti-depressant to use for anxiety disorders.  If its working for you, continue to take it and report any unpleasent side effects to your doctor.|Celexa is a bit older in regards to the drugs used to treat anxiety in depression. Actually, due to its side effects, the makers of the drug released a new version called Lexapro. In regards to effectiveness, it can really help to bring panic and anxiety under control but the effects are far greater when combined with psychotherapy as well. If you&#039;re not already seeing a therapist I would highly recommend considering it. It could actually speed up your recovery and help give lasting results. I would only comment that while Celexa can completely level out your mood, it might also make it harder to feel really happy or really sad, even if you want to. Good Luck!|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celexa
Has anyone had success with switching to Lexapro from Celexa to lessen sexual side effects of the SSRI?|3|I began taking an SSRI (generic Celexa) for the first time a little over a month ago.  It is working great, and all of the side effects have gone away except the sexual ones.  I can&#039;t have an orgasm and my genitals feel somewhat numb.  Today my doctor suggested switching to Lexapro, the newer, name brand version of Celexa.  Has anyone else had any success with this switch or am I just wasting time?  My next step is to try Wellbutrin.  Any other suggestions to get my sex life back?|Hello,  I have taken many anti-dep and have taken along time to find one that fits all my needs. I had a really hard time sexually when on prozac and zoloft, etc. I let my new doc know the problem was affecting my life and he suggested Wellbutrin. So I take a smaller dose of lexapro for the depression because you can only take so much wellbutrin. Then I take a dosage of Wellbutrin to help take the sexual side affects away, which also helps with depression. That changed my life taking both drugs together!!! Been taken them for over 4 yrs. now and I thank my doc all the time! My sex drive is actually usually in over drive now :)|wellbutrin is working for me,give it a try.
I BEEN ON CELEXA NOW FOR 10YRS AND I WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD.WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST THE BEST METHOD OF STOPPIN?|2|Stop taking it. My husband and I want to have another baby and I know of what I researched babies are harmfully effected by it. I just don&#039;t want to stop becasue I am afraid of haveing horrible withdrawls and I have awful panic attacks so what would be the best method of getting of of these pills? I don&#039;t wanna tae them anymore.|speak to your doctor first of course, then slowly.. emphasis on SLOWLY.. wean yourself off the drugs. you are correct in thinking these medications are not good for your baby. remember that whatever youre taking, the baby takes as well.my suggestion, cut your doses slowly, over a period of weeks. if you take 100 mgs, go down to 75 for two weeks. then to 50 mgs for two more weeks. and so on, until you get down to a very small dose. at that point, you will be feeling the symptoms of withdraw (they are different in everyone and can be unpleasant). now you should take your pill (in the low dose) every other day for two weeks. then every third day, and so on, until you&#039;re able to stop taking it altogether. i know this sounds like a long process, and you may want to just stop taking it.. please believe me when i say that is a very bad idea. ive been there, and i tried doing it.. and plummeted into one of the deepest depressions of my life. your body is used to this medication, especially after 10 years, so it may take some time to wean it out of your system. good luck to you and your family. stay strong! :)
How dangerous would it be to stop taking Celexa cold turkey?|2|Call your physician to get a definite answer.  Something like this really shouldn&#039;t be asked online and left up to unknown people in cyberspace ;)  Much of the answer you&#039;re seeking depends on the dosage you&#039;re taking and how long you&#039;re taking it.  There&#039;s always some possible effects of stopping any medication cold turkey, so just talk to your doc :)  You should be able to get an answer over the phone if you call and speak with a nurse or someone in the office.|The vat majority of people who stop Celexa abruptly experience no unpleasant discontinuation symptoms whatsoever. Some have temporary, flu-like symptoms. It is quite rare for the effects of stopping Celexa to be anywhere near life threatening.The most likely effect is a resumption of depressive/anxisous symptomology if you discontinue Celexa before your treatment is complete.~M~
Can antidepressants like Celexa actually cause depression?|3|My doctor prescribed Celexa for PTSD because I&#039;ve had sleeping problems ever since I got back from fighting in Iraq. I didn&#039;t really feel depressed before, but now I feel like doing nothing but sleeping even though I still can&#039;t. I have a date tomorrow with a cool girl, and I&#039;m not excited about it like I should be. The idea of going to work is dreadful. God! It sucks.|There is every possibility that it is interacting unfavorably with your body&#039;s chemistry and actually causing depression that was absent previously.If you&#039;ve been using this drug for a while and the symptoms are getting worse rather than better, then you should contact your doctor and ask to be changed.  Also, there are alternatives to anti-depressants if all you&#039;re experiencing is sleep disturbance.  You could try a sleep aid such as Ambien (which I use and like VERY well).  Or you could try psychological therapy without the use of drug therapy.Talk to your doctor or get a referral to a different doctor if he/she is reluctant to help.|I really think it could.  Maybe your dose should be lowered and see if that helps.  I have definately heard people say they felt kinda like zombies after taking SSRI&#039;s.  But maybe that is only if theyre taking too much.  I&#039;ve also heard people say ssri&#039;s makes them just &quot;not care&quot; about things,.  Could also be the wrong SSRI for you - maybe Lexapro would be good.  P.S.  Thank you for your service!
Has anyone heard that you can&#039;t get pregnant while on Celexa?|5|I&#039;ve been trying to get pregnant and I heard that I wont be able to as long as I&#039;m taking Celexa.  This came from a nurse so it kind of concerened me.  I was wondering if anyone got pregnant while taking Celexa.|I was taking Celexa at the time I found out about my last pregnancy. My doctor took me off of it right away because it can cause birth defects. Never heard of not being able to get pregnant while being on it though. Ask your doctor to be sure.|Celexa can cause birth defects in pregnant women, and is not advised if you are breast feeding.  So, even if you can get pregnant, don&#039;t.    Definitely check with your doctor about these serious risks.|I dont knwo if you cant get pregnant but I will tell you you shouldn&#039;t.  It isnt healthty to be pregnant on any medication.|I haven&#039;t....but I am happy about this. Maybe you should talk to your Doctor about this.
What do I do if I miss a does of my celexa?|2|I just started 2 weeks ago and it&#039;s helping but I forgot to take it this morning. What should I do?Thanks|Celexa and all antidepressants take about 6 to 10 weeks to show any improvement so I am inclined here to think part of your results are psychosomatic, you want it to work. If you miss a dose and it hasn&#039;t been too long take it, if not wait until the next dose.
What can you tell me about Celexa?|2|I&#039;ve been having problems with stress and depression.  The worst things are that I&#039;m always yelling at the kids, or crying when I&#039;m constantly arguing with my husband.   I have a good life, I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m so on-the-edge all the time.   Will Celexa help?  I&#039;ve never heard of it before.  I was on Prozac in the 1990&#039;s, and that worked well for me at the time, for the problems I was having then. BTW, I&#039;m 45 and have 4 kids.  Two stepkids (12 and 15), and two little boys (7 months and 3.5 years).   My husband and I&#039;ve been married almost five years.|don&#039;t take celexa. that&#039;ll just make u more depressed. talk to your husband. you need a romantic side in your marriage. go out to eat and be romantic. be sexy to him. more romance means more happiness. dont try to be superwoman, you need a change. i really hope it works out for you, i feel your pain.
Are restless twitchy legs with celexa normal?|2|i&#039;ve had really strange feelings starting celexa. i&#039;ve been on it for about 4 days and my right leg feels so tense and keeps having random twitching. it also feels like i have severe dizziness when im walking because i almost had to stop and sit down on the sidewalk cuz i felt like my legs couldn&#039;t work. is this normal and will the symptoms start to go away once i take it for awhile?|I&#039;m felling the same things.  I&#039;ve had nausea for about a week, with no appetite.  I have twitchy legs at night, headache and feel dizzy.  Apparently these are quite normal until this medication gets into your system. Good luck!
Can you get  a&quot;high&quot; from uisng celexa (ctralomroma) if used recreationally?|3|No doctors/ douchebags agianst having a good time.|Nope.  A) It&#039;s not a stimulant or depressant.  It affects the amount of serotonin available in the brain by blocking the reabsorption rate of seratonin in neurotransmitters.  B) It takes several weeks of steady use to affect users.  Taking it on a random basis won&#039;t do anything, even if it&#039;s not ingested in &quot;conventional&quot; form.|you need something better than celexa
Celexa-- what are some of the foods that work against this med?|3|I have heard that there are several foods that you should not eat or drink when you are taking celexa.....anybody know of any?|As a healthcare provider I can tell you that the only thing that works against Celexa in the food and drink category is alcohol.|I know of no food, unless it contains alcohol.
What is the difference if I take Celexa before or after food.?|2|The directions say it can be taken with or without food, but my doctor insists I take it AFTER I eat breakfast or it will be wasted on me.Does anyone know Why?|It&#039;s possible your doctor knows something I don&#039;t, but I cannot find anything to substantiate why this would be the case.Celexa is one of the best tolerated anti-depressants, and has very few drug or food interactions.  The absorption has not been shown to be affected by the absence or presence of food, fatty or otherwise.  Its terminal half-life is 35 hours, so even if you stopped taking it suddenly, levels of the drug would still be measurable for almost a week, which basically says that if you were off by a few hours, it truly shouldn&#039;t make much of a difference so long as you had been taking it for awhile (as opposed to just starting).Sometimes it&#039;s possible that a doctor or other healthcare professional would tell you to take a medication in which it truly doesn&#039;t matter what time of day you take it at a certain point of the day simply to facilitate helping you get into a pattern so as not to miss a dose.  However, that doesn&#039;t explain why he/she would say it would be &quot;wasted&quot; though.The best thing to do is to ask him/her yourself.  I&#039;d be curious to know the reasoning as well.
Is Celexa a drug that should be taken long term. Does it affect memory?|4|I have been taking Celexa for 3 yrs and  i am having some problems with my memory and some moodiness and depression. I am looking for some help somewhere because my doctor said it is a good med and another dr. said that it will mix up your head and it shouldn&#039;t be taken for a long period of times so i am looking for a third opinion on here from someone.|gosh, i was just put on that drug one month ago, i looked it up on the Internet to see what it was all about, it is for severe depression, i don&#039;t remember  any of your side effects though, my doctor did tell me that it was not addictive, i will be very interested in seeing your answers,have a safe an good day!!|You should consult a doctor and not take lay people&#039;s opinions.  Every one is different and reacts to meds different.  Maybe something else is wrong?|That drug is fairly new. It only got approved shortly before you started taking it. There are multiple patients who i&#039;ve seen with this problem. most of them were switched over to Zoloft. I found a forum of people tracking side effects, maybe you are interested.
Is celexa going to make me gain weight?|2|So far my appetite is surpressed, but will the medication itself cause me to gain weight?|most anti d&#039;s cause weight gain. i took pexeva and put on a lot of weight but switched to generic celexa and lost some of it. just make sure you monitor your food intake and exercise the way you always have.
Is it safe to take Celexa w/ Norco, Dilaudid and Ativan?|6|I am prescribed Celexa for anxiety, to reduce blood pressure and for depression and Ativan for anxiety as well.  I take Norco for migraine pain and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.  Looking up these on drug interaction websites, it appears that there are several moderate drug interactions, which all result in a depressed CNS.  Does anyone else combine these?  I am paranoid, especially after hearing about Anna Nicole and how she combined antidressants and painkillers, etc.|You should ask your doctor because there is a risk of increased toxicity including respiratory depression but this will depend on dosage and your tolerance level and what your body.You can&#039;t stop lorazepam abruptly or you may go crazy if you have used it more than a few weeks as it is highly addictive. You can even take seizures from stopping that drug suddenly. See this site http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/|This is a question for your pharmacist.  Call your pharmacist or stop to see him/ her and ask them about this.|Do not just trust the judgement of the doctor and pharmacist.  They might not be paying attention and might just give you the prescriptions without trying.  I was very sick once for that very reason.  Neither the doctor nor the pharmacist was paying attention and I was give another prescription that reacted poorly with a medication I was already taking.  Also, did the same doctor prescribe all the medications and did the same pharmacist dispense all the medications?  They can&#039;t look out for what they don&#039;t know about.  Call your doctor and ask them point blank what you asked us, tell him about your research and concerns.  Good luck.|from a nursing perspective,the combination of narcotics and benzodiazapines can cause respiratory and cns depression. I hope you see a chronic pain specialist because norco and dilaudid are highly addictive. People do combine these medicatons. Ask yourself these questions: I am taking one of the strongest narcotics on the market ( dilaudid ) and a very strong benzo ( ativan ). With time, my body will become acclimated to these drugs. What is the next level? Should I consider alternatives to these meds?There are many programs that incorporate exercise and cox inhibitors. These programs are much more successful than taking narcotics. Best of luck.|if your doctor and pharmacist have this info, trust their judgement.
How long until the side effects of coming off Celexa wear off?   A little dizzy at times and pressure in ears.|4|I know I&#039;m not supposed to stop cold turkey but I didn&#039;t renew my script and the doc&#039;s out of town and I wanted to come off.

Just take it in the morning.|Go to Google, type Celexa in there, hit the enter key and read what pops up.  Or, go to your pharmacy and ask for his drug stores data sheet on Celexa, and he will print that off.  Or you can go to the library, look it up in the Physician&#039;s Desk Reference, and if you can interpret all the Greek words, you might can figure out what it is saying.  On Yahoo Search engine, I got the following:&quot;Celexa® is classified pharmacologically as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, commonly known as SSRIs. The use of SSRIs and related drugs may be associated with side effects such as, sexual function abnormalities that can occur in up to 60% of the people taking SSRIs. Discontinued use, especially when abrupt, may result in spontaneous side effects including anxiety, irritability, headaches, insomnia, and confusion. Side effects may also include insomnia, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, and decreased sexual drive. Celexa® can cause anorexia (weight loss) in some people and weight gain in others.&quot;Now is that all of them?  Probably not, but those are the major ones|You can easily find the side effects of Celexa on the web.  The thing few people seem to check is that side effects must be listed if they occur in 2% or 3% of the tested population.  You may begin to feel side effects in two or three days.  Many side effects subside after one or two weeks, once your body adjusts.  If you get a rash, thoughts of suicide, or motor problems such as stumbling a lot or keeping your balance, contact your physician immediately.The side effect that has given people most concern  is thoughts of suicide.  Usually this has not been a problem unless people had thoughts of suicide BEFORE they began taking the drug.  If they did, Celexa might reduce the inhibitions to go through with these thoughts.A skin rash may not seem that significant, but it can be a sign of a more serious problem, so do not ignore it.It should not be taken if pregnant.If it makes certain symptoms of depression worse or it gives you mania (can&#039;t sleep, racing thoughts, can&#039;t sit still), tell your doctor.You should always, ALWAYS talk these effects over with your doctor.  If he won&#039;t discuss them or someone in his office won&#039;t discuss them with you, go to another doctor  and on&#039;t take the medication until you get answers.|You feel the side effects if there are any. Not everyone has side effects. The only way to know the side effects is to ask your Doctor, or to look on the bottle...OR to go to the drug makers website.
My husband started taking Celexa and he is having alot of restless leg stuff going on at night.?|3|Almost every 5 minutes he has a startle reaction. This is a real problem for me; I can&#039;t get any sleep! He doesn&#039;t know he is having this going on. Has anyone else had this side effect?  HATE it. Thanks.|Celexa acts on the CNS so it&#039;s more than possible that it could cause symptoms like restless leg reactions.  He&#039;d better talk to his prescribing physician.|How high is the dose that he is taking? I was on 20 mg celexa for 2 days and I couldn&#039;t stay still at all. I actually had panic attacks because my body was so... drugged up?
Anyone who has/is taking celexa what is it like? Side effects?|3|I have been taking celexa for about 10 months now and I was just wondering if some of the side effects that I feel are just from my body&#039;s chemistry reacting to the meds or from the celexa itself, not making a difference who it is. First questions are what about sex drive/performance? Did you have really vivid nightmares/dreams? Anything else that really stood out?|I took it for 2 years and never had any side effects. I was just happier than I had been but not overly so. I was convinced they were sugar pills. LOL. Other than the elevated happy feeling, I never noticed anything different. I slept better because I wasnt up at night worrying about things and getting depressed. You said you&#039;ve been taking it for ten months, do you have any side effects already?  If not, you more than likely won&#039;t. Good luck!|i just started celexa, this is going to be my 3rd day on it, after switching from cymbalta 60mg. im on 40mg celexa, my side effects so far are abdominal pain occasionaly, head ache, foggy headed, LOTS of drowsyness, which is why i take it at night, supressed appetite, and yes! very very VERY vivit nightmares and dreams, the dreams im having are like the dreams i have whenever i take my seroquel.
I was put on Celexa for my GAD,  and I got a fever right now on the 4th day on it.  Can Celexa give u a fever?|3|I also felt very weak, all my muscles were very sore.|Yes it can, and if you feel weak and have sore muscles too perhaps it might be best to contact your doctor? If you have a read of the information sheet that came with the drug, it should list various side-effects, and what to do if you should experience them.|Not that I know of.  Celexa is pretty mild and has few side effects.
Celexa can you tell me you side effects?|2|What kind of side effects did you have a while taking this medication? Please go into detail.|Typical Side Effects:  - headache, nausea, dry mouth, sweating, sleepiness or insomnia, and diarrhea or constipation, weight gain, loss of libido. Most everything but the weight gain and loss of libido usually goes away within a couple of weeks.Not So Common Side Effects: Tremor, acne, disruption in your menstrual cycle.http://crazymeds.org/The side effects from SSRI-antidepressants are far more serious than just the addiction to it and withdrawal symptoms. Many individuals who took an SSRI-antidepressant or tried to get off an SSRI-antidepressant experienced the most horrible adverse reactions. Many individuals have suffered for years or are still suffering because they experienced an extremely negative reaction to one of these drugs!http://www.antidepressantsfacts.com/cele...
Is it ok to take Nyquil while on Celexa?|4|Because I&#039;m on Celexa, and I have a bad cold, and I need to sleep... will I be ok if I take this or is there something else I should take?|No it is not ok. Nyquil has pain relievers in it. You should not add more pain relievers by taking Celexa.  Its over medicating yourself. Don&#039;t take both. If you have a cold or have the flu call your doc or atleast the pharmacy for advice on what you should take.|No!|Celexa does not increase the effects of alcohol. Nevertheless, it&#039;s considered unwise to combine Celexa with alcohol or any other drug that affects the brain.
I am going to take E on Friday and I take 10 MG of celexa I did some research and it looks like you can get ?|7|high still, I wanted to make sure it is ok. I DO NOT WANT any comments on how bad esctacy is as a drug, save it for someone who cares. I want to know if the two are ok, and if I will feel it, or if I should abstain for a day of my celexa? Thank you and please no rude comments.|I doubt it&#039;s going to kill you. It&#039;s always a risk with any drug so just take a half or a quarter to start, give it 45 minutes, and see how you go. Don&#039;t worry about these other people, they haven&#039;t spent enough time away from their precious computers to experience life. They&#039;re just afraid of what they don&#039;t know.|If celexa is a medication and you are going to take drugs with that I would hate to think what the outcome will be, but since you dont care I dont need to tell you that it might have some serious adverse effects do I?|You don&#039;t want stupid comments try not putting in a stupid question, what are you thinking. Do you have any idea what this stuff does to your body. I am a Youth Worker I have seen to many young people destroy their lives for this crap. Grow up|So, you are going to not take an anti-depressant in order to take an illegal drug...classic.  If you don&#039;t care then I don&#039;t either.  I&#039;m all about weeding out the gene pool.|Ha. I can&#039;t even begin to explain to you how stupid this question looks. So I&#039;m not going to.|do you care if you end up dead?
What, if any, are the physical side effects of stopping celexa cold turkey?|1|Hi Angie,Not a good idea. It&#039;s never good to suddenly stop any med. You need to wean off gradually. Celexa is a newer gen. SSRI. Withdrawal symptoms would probably include anxiety, sweats, agitation, plus maybe more. Talk to the prescribing Doc. The longer you&#039;ve been on it. The more careful you need to be in stopping. If you&#039;re experiencing side FX. Bring those to the Doc&#039;s attention.
Should I continue to take Celexa if I continually feel ill?|4|I just started taking Celexa but last night I felt really ill.  Nausea, to the point of wondering if I should run to the bathroom to vomit.  I actually took some rolaids.  I know that starting a new medication always has side effects but when should I possibly start to worry if the side efects don&#039;t go away?  I want to stop taking the medication b/c of how I feel but I know if I do, I may feel worse or start to have bad thoughts and go into a deep depressive state.|Humm...This is a tricky question to answer. As someone who has degree of psychology and who also suffers from depression and takes medication for it, I know quite a bit about dealing with side effects (from both sides of the experience!).Neasea is a really common side effect. When I first started taking Zoloft (chemically similar) a few years back, I was so neaseated that I couldn&#039;t even knit without wanting to vomit. I persevered though, and after a couple of weeks, the side effects disappeared. And the worst side effects only lasted for 2-3 days, rapidly decreasing after that time.If you feel as though you can stick it out with the side effects for two weeks, I think it&#039;s probably a good idea to do so and see if the side effects are still bad.If you do decide to stop taking the medication, don&#039;t lose hope! Different antidepressants have different side effect profiles.From my point of view, I eventually stopped taking zoloft and now take mirtazapine (Rameron, I think is the trade name in the USA. In Australia, it&#039;s Avanza). I had no neasea side effects - quite the opposite actually. I felt hungry all the time for about a month even if I&#039;d eaten a full meal that would normally have me feeling really full or even sick.Celexa isn&#039;t for everyone. If you really can&#039;t cope with it and want to go off it, it&#039;s ok. I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re on a fairly low dose to start off with, right? If so, stopping shouldn&#039;t harm you. There are other medications you can try. You might go through a few before you find one that really suits you but hang in there! Just because one didn&#039;t work for you doesn&#039;t mean at all that they all will.If you change medications, make sure to tell your doctor that you want an antidepressant for which neasea is not a common side effect. Tetracyclic antidepressants may be less likely to have neasea than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, so talk to your doctor.The antidepressant effect of the medication takes at least a few days to start to do anything, and peak effect isn&#039;t likely to be reached until the one month/ six week mark - and when it does start to work, you may find that everything looks a lot better.|give it 6-1o weeks, side effects usually deminish within that time.|Continue taking it.Call your doc if it happens again. It could have been a fluke.
What was your experience with celexa?|2|anyone who takes or has taken celexa?  How did it work for you and what side effects did you experience?|I took it for about a week. It made me SO tired. I slept for two days straight. Otherwise, nothing.
Im switching my Wellbutrin with Celexa, will I have withdrawls?|2|Im currently on Wellbutrin 150mg and Effexer 150mg and Trazodone 100mg and my insurance just expired.  Im going with a cheaper version called Celexa to take the place of the Wellbutrin, will I have withdrawls?|From my experience, and I worked to help people get off these drugs for 2 years.   There are side effects from withdrawal that the second drug will try to cover up.   But, it is unbalancing your hormone system more and can back fire in the long run.These drugs effect the pituitary gland (the master gland of the body).  This then effects your adrenal glands which then unbalances the entire hormonal/glandular system.    The body is now balanced on the head of a pin and when you go off the drug, it will unbalance further.   Depending on how your body does this (and everyone has a unique genetic makeup) will depend on what will happen.Should you want to get off these drugs and treat your body with whole food supplements instead, or if the drugs start to make things worse there is a program you can find at www.theroadback.org.
Can anyone tell me anything about Celexa?|3|I have mild depression and my doc prescribed me Lexapro. That worked well for me except one thing, the price. It&#039;s almost $90 a month and the pharmasist suggested I switch to Celexa which I could get for $4. So I had my doc call in a prescription for Celexa. What are the side effects with Celexa? Are they better or worse than Lexapro? Can anyone help me?|celexa works for me.  10mg 3 times a day.  side effects are hard to know because of my work schedule.the first 3 weeks i was on them i have stomach problems. constipation. but after that i was fine. sometimes a dry mouth but i am diabetic.  you sometimes have to switch pills several time before you find what works for you.  i do not take them when i am pregnantgood luck|Celexa made me feel like I wanted to jump off a cliff.  It made my depression 10X worse than what it was before I started on it.  Lexapro worked for me, but every single person is different with these types of drugs.  Its really trial and error.  You have to try for yourself.  I hope whatever you decide on works for you because I know how hard it is.  Good luck.
Is it safe to take Celexa and Benadryl?|2|Will these two meds interact with one another in any way?|Celexa is an SSRI form of an antidepressant.Benadryl is an antihistamine; one has nothing to do with the other...Here are drugs that may NOT be taken safely  with celexa;http://health.yahoo.com/depression-medic...
Is Celexa(or its generic brand) used to treat OCD?|4|I have the obsessive part of OCD (no compulsions whatsoever just obessessions(thoughts I don&#039;t act on).  And Depression and anxiety.I was prescribed celexa.  Anyone else been put on this with OCD?  Can you tell me your experience?|i am on celexa, and i too, have ocd thoughts.  it is funny you asked b/c i was just speaking w/my therapist a/b this issue.  and we are going to give it some time and then maybe add or switch to wellbutrin or another anti-depressant.  but, another option is taking an anti-anxiety med when  you are having an especially bad day w/ocd thoughts (xanax, klonnipin (sp!), etc.)  i&#039;ll update you if i get on another one and let you know how that&#039;s working!|Yes, it is. I know someone who is on Celexa for OCD and he says it works great for him. I am also on it for anxiety and it works great for me too.|i have never heard of celexa being used for ocd. usually, Paxil or Zoloft is prescribed. however, some drugs do have &quot;off label&quot; uses meaning that they can be used for things that they are not necessarily indicated for (example: using Benadryl for sleep).
Celexa (citalopram), How long it takes to work and whats the side effects..?|5|I have been on this for 2 weeks and today I had a very bad stomach cramp. I guess its a side effect from the drug, also I have not noticed any changes  to my mood. How long it takes for this drug to work ? thanks|I think it can take up to around 6 weeks before Citalopram begins to work fully.  If people experience side effects with anti-depressants they&#039;re normally most intense during the first 2 weeks then ease or go completley.  You could read up about Citalopram and anti-depressants in general on the mental health charity Mind&#039;s website.  Hope the drug helps you http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Bookl...|Takes 6-8 weeks and even than may need to be adjusted to effect.  Your doc should have scheduled another consult with you in a bout 6 weeks.  Heres more info on side effects:http://health.yahoo.com/depression-medic...|About 2 weeks, side effects vary from person to person. If you have only experienced it today I do think it&#039;s unlikely to be a side effect, though I could be wrong. Do speak to your prescribing doctor about it.|it takes up to four weeks for citalopram to start working properly. but don&#039;t rely on the drugs to work wonders try getting to the root cause of your depression try therapy it works wonders for me.
Does anyone else find that Celexa makes them sleep alot?|2|It makes me constantly sleepy. I am on 10mg.|I&#039;m not on Celexa myself, but a couple of side effects include fatigue and drowsiness, so no need to be worried. If it&#039;s become a hassle, though, switching medication might be effective- though a lot of antidepressants will make you drowsy.
Can I drink alcohol while taking Celexa?|5|I take 20mg a day for anxiety. Can I drink alcohol on it?|Yes-you can.  This is a bad choice for every day use though, especially if you&#039;re young...alcohol basically destroys the effects of anti-depressants--more than ANY other drug! (even if used for anxiety-though benzos like xanax and klonopin (strictly for anxiety, but minorly addictive) are potentiated by alcohol consumption).  Celexa is the most selective SSRI-next to paroxetine (Paxil) (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) and can therefore be a hit or miss type of drug, depending on the person&#039;s diverse neuronal chemistry and &#039;needs&#039;.  It barely effects norepinephrine and to a lesser extent, dopamine.  Effexor hits NE and DA at high doses, and Cymbalta is simply the best on the market-hits all those 3 neurotransmitters.  Perhaps you should switch; maybe a more advanced SSRI or SSNRI would decrease your desire to drink.But if you do, I&#039;d suggest only on the weekends...and in relatively small amounts.  The combination does not always cause more &#039;depression&#039; nor more &#039;cognitive and motor impairment&#039;.  Alcohol can actually have the paradoxical effect-inducing a manic or hypomanic state...as short-lived as it may be.But if Celexa is working well, I strongly suggest switching to its direct chemical &#039;cousin&#039;, more like derivative; a purified verison...Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate)...more bang for the buck, more potent, less side-effects, and less mg dose required.  Hope this helps.|No, You must not drink alcohol when You are taking the medication &quot; Celexa &quot; ( medically known as &quot; Citalopram Hydrobromide &quot;) . Alcohol is very interactive with this medication. Use in combination may result in additive central nervous system depression and impairment of judgement, thinking, and psychomotor skills. You are also strongly advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery when taking Celexa.Overall, no alcohol should be consumed with any kind of medicine. Good Luck !|I must disagree. Alcohol does not reduce the effect of all medications, only a very few, and in these cases it is clearly advised against drinking in the information leaflet and usually the label too.The problem with mixing alcohol and celexa is that it can make you feel very tired, drowsy; even moody.  Some people find they can drink very small amount (ie the odd glass of beer or wine) without problems but going out and drinking is definately not recommended.|ALCOHOL reduces the effect of any medication
Which antidepressant, Celexa or Paxil is better for OCD?|9|I am also on Adderal 10XR for ADD. I&#039;m going to the doctor on Friday, and we have talked about adding one of these meds. I can only take very low doses of SSRIs because they make my ADD alot worse. Which of the two has the least effect on your sexual drive? Thanks for any input. I really value other people&#039;s personal experiences regarding these types of medications verus just what the literature says statistically you should experience. Thanks!|i will be very honest w/u i have taken paxil for along time it is next to if not impossible to ever go off of~~~please dont make the mistake i did and start taking it ~~~anything besides it believe me withdrawal symptoms make you feel totally out of it!!!|I took Paxil for over 8 years (30 mg. once daily). I tapered off slowly,5mg. less every few weeks then 5 mg every other day.I&#039;ve been paxil free for about a week now. No real problems,but I know I did it super slowFrom what my Dr. tells me now they switch you to prozac to ween you off paxil.                          Report Abuse|I only know about Paxil. I honestly belive Paxil has given me a quality of life I have never had before. Even if it is not for everyone, It does help me function as a happy rational adult. I have taken it for 6 years with no harsh side effects. I also Take &#039;Concerta&quot; for ADHD. I have not had bad side effects in combination with my ADHD or the meds. I have taken for it (also had taken Ritalin). Paxil does decrease my sex drive a bit. I have had to explore other ways to increase my libido. It can be managed for the most part so as not to disappoint my hunny. I do have to work on trying new things (nothing perv just monogamous fun). Once I am in the mood, I have no problem fully enjoying every bit of the festivities. That&#039;s all good. It is just the motivation that slows me down.I wish I knew more about the other one. Perhaps you can get some good answers from others. Best wishes!|PAXIL IS WAY TO ADDICTING|It depends on your body. Everyone is different on all drugs. I have been on paxil for about 12 years and it has been the best thing I ever did, but it is different for everyone. Talk to your doctor. Don&#039;t listen to the ones that only took it for a week. Being on a drug for a week will only bring the side effects. After a week or two it will be 100 times better. It also does not leave me feeling like I have no emotions. I can still cry. I can still have times where I feel depressed. Paxil can be good if you take it correctly and past a week.|I can&#039;t speak for the Celexa, but Paxil made me CRAZY, and not in a good way.  Paxil made me figity, nervous, anxious, my hands shook, and my heart rate and breathing rate went way up.  It also prevented orgasm.  Listen to this part -- it didn&#039;t lesson the libido, but instead prevented the actual orgasm.  It was one of the most frustrating things!!!  It didn&#039;t effect my desire or sexual drive, but I could NEVER GET TO ORGASM, even after almost an hour.  I stopped from exhaustion and cried from frustration then.  I hope I&#039;ve made that clear.  I hated Paxil and took it only for one week, took another week to clear my system.  I will NEVER take it again, not even if I were paid a huge amount of money.Hey, but that&#039;s just my opinion from my own personal experience.  :-/|*Its not what one is better, its what one is better for you .You have other meds and medical  stuff to consider.|I had been on Lexapro for the last year and stopped taking it just because i dont like being a zombie.Oh yeah also i like to feel things and I couldnt on Lexapro.Most psychotropic drugs are horrible and should be labeled as such:Warning may make you crazy or crazier than you already are.You probably wont be having sex because you will never feel like it.You may sleep all the time or you may never sleep again,so dont expect a normal life.You may feel no emotion or feel emotions you never knew you had.I personally would rather deal with my depression than try to drug it away.I feel better than i have in a long time.I am sure you are like what the hell is she talkin about?I thought i would share a little on my experience of anti drugs!Letting you know they mostly all do the same thing to everyone but people keep taking them because their doctor through the process of elimination said this is what mental illness you have now let me get paid more money to give you this medication and not really care if your side effects are bad i will just put you on another just as bad.Thats the dang truth.
Has Celexa made any of you hypomanic?|7|Long story short: I ended up in the ER because celexa had induced a hypomanic episode with me.  Now, I amon a high dose of Klonipin and Seroquel to bring me back down.  Has this happened to anyone else?  What meds for depression/anxiety did not do this?|Most anti-depressants run the risk of triggering manic and/or hypo-manic episodes. Primarily this occurs with individuals who have a history of Bi-Polar (I or II) disorder. If you have a diagnosis of Bi-Polar disorder you may be prescribed a mood stabilizer (such as lithium or depakote) in addition to anti-depressants. This will balance out the potential of the anti-depressant to cause manic episodes.Another possibility is that your doctor will prescribe one of the following mood stabilizers that also can have anti-depressant effects:lithium lamotrigine olanzapine (Zyprexa) quetiapine (Seroquel) If you have not been diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder than your doctor and you may explore alternative anti-depressants and/or a dosage change. This answer is not a substitute for medical care or speaking with your doctor but will hopefully help out.|i was on klonopin for 14 yrs  now on xanax..you being on klonopin and seroquel  will work good...ive never heard of celexa doing that to anyone...|Not Celexa but a lot of meds put me in a hypo-manic or even a complete manic state. It is so tricky. The seroquel should bring you down. I can&#039;t really say what meds work for me because everyone is so different. You just have to keep trying. Hang in there!|Yeah. I was made hypo manic by a 20mg dose of cipramil/talohexal on top of my normal 400mg tegritol twice a day (bedtime and early morning 4-5 am) and 100mg of lamictal (at bed time routine). To bring me down I was given something similar to Valium and sent home to bed and advised to take a reduced dose of the citalopram. I then saw my doc who  took it down to 10mg (half a 20mg citalopram tablet) and I&#039;m fine now. It is a low dose but it is within the range that still has therapeutic benefits in my med regime.  All is good now.|This happened to my partner after she was put on Zoloft. It&#039;s also how she was diagnosed as Bi-Polar. After many combinations of meds being tried, she is now on Lithium, GeoDon, and is still on the Zoloft. It seems to be working, but when you are on lithium you have to have blood work done regularly. There is a very small margin of getting the levels right in your system. Too low, and you don&#039;t get any benefit from it. Too high and it gets toxic in your system and you can get really sick. You also have to be extremely careful with other prescribed and over the counter meds. Ex: with Lithium, you can&#039;t take NSAIDS. AND, certain meds can either cause different reactions in your system OR they can make your Lithium levels get really high. One time she injured her back and was prescribed muscle relaxors. She slept for nearly two days after taking two doses. The third day, she had her blood tested and she was at a toxic level. My point? You have to be really careful with all of these meds AND you have to make sure you are seeing a psychiatrist that specializes in Bi-Polar treatment. There is relief out there once you find the correct combination for you. My best advice is to read everything you can about it AND if advised about drug interactions, take it seriously.Good luck!|You poor thing, you must be a zombie. Your Dr. should have put you on a mood stablizer, or your mood stablizer should have been increased to avoid what happenned. I am on celexa (8 yrs.) as well as a mood stablizer and am doing well. I hope you have a good Dr. that you trust. It takes time but he/she will find a combination that works for you. If not, re-evaluate your Dr.s.  I wish you the best of luck, it&#039;s tough. But you will get through!!sincerely, to hell and back
Has anyone experienced itching when the weather is warm while taking celexa?|2|Since the warm weather has returned, I have started itching again.  I started taking Celexa last September and noticed then that when the weather was warm, I starting itching.  At that time I did not associate it with the Celexa.  But since the itching has returned, I wonder if it could be from the Celexa.  If not, does anyone have any other explanation for my itching.  It is all over my body, but especially my lower back and arms.  Thank you very much.|I take celebrex which is in the general family and I am itching again so bad I feel I am about to lose my mind. I am going to stop taking it and see if it helps even though I need it. But I can&#039;t take the itching. If the itching stops the doc will just have to find me something else.
Is Celexa a drug that once you take you will never stop?|3|Seems like all the comments on  here about Celexa is that is a long term drug and not just to be taken for a few months. It sounds like going off of Celexa is not easy. Is Celexa a dependent drug?|I took it for awhile. a few months, discontinued it when the dr and I felt I no longer needed it, and I had no problems. However that was me. You did not mention what you are being treated for, or at what dose. It is not a medication I would just stop taking, but along with your dr, it is possible if you both find that it has done its job, that you can be weaned off it safely, and go on and live a normal happy life. JUST DONT STOP COLD TURKEY|No. It is not. My opinion is that it is easy to taper off. Just talk with your doctor about how she/he recommends a patient taper off of Celexa. There may be additional information on this process on the Internet. Some people on here have stated some difficulties tapering off of some medications (Effexor), but I haven&#039;t seen anything about Celexa.
I have been taking celexa now for a few months and cant believe how much weight I have gained! ?|2|Anyone else having this problem? I have been really watching what I eat, working out and trying everything else!  Wondering if I lower my dose if that would make any significant changes?? Im a 24 year old female on 20mg.  Is there anything else that anyone can suggest that wont make me gain weight?? Thanks!|Go back to your doctor and speak about your concerns.Don&#039;t lower your dose without discussing it first - because you could have a relape.I have had no problem with weight gain on prozac, paxil or effexor
What are other&#039;s withdrawal experiences from wellbutrin and celexa?|3|I stopped taking Wellbutrin and the only withdrawal experience was the return of my sex drive....Hallelujah!|I had no withdrawals from either one.|I had a headache for a couple days that was it. Motrin helped with that.
Does anyone know if Celexa has a side effect of itchy skin?|3|I have been on it for two weeks now and about three days ago I have noticed that my palms of hands, fingers, arms and ankles itch like mad. Also, I have looked on website, but can&#039;t find interactions with other meds I take.|Celexa is a partner drug with lexapro. I got real itchy just like you while I was taking lexepro.|I take celexa to. But I always itched. Those red dots that spread, the more you itch &#039;em. those are common in the summer time. I read all about those on the internet, those are common because of the humidity. Were suppose to change clothes more often in the day in the summer time. &amp; take cooler showers. The hot water opens pours of the skin.
Celexa and side Effects after 1 year?|4|I have been on Celexa to treat general anxiety for 1 year... After my Dad died suddenly it really took a toll. Anyways, the Celexa really helped me out and seem to work. I am only on 10 mg, and recently I have been feeling a little &quot;out of it&quot;, kind of a stoned or drunk  or lightheaded feeling. I even had a case of vertigo, which has never happened before.Is it possible to get side effects from a Medication even after you have been on it for 1 year? I have been checked by doctors and there is nothing physically wrong. I have not gone back to the Psychiatrist yet.|If you come off it quickly or try to take yourself off it or even forget a few pills, you can get the type of feelings you mentioned .|very unlikely you would get symptoms from the celexa after a year. Sounds like to me something else is going on, to give you the symptoms you described. I would not hesitate to get a second opinion. Also  set an appointment with your psychiatrist. Oh have you skipped any doseages and just started up again?|To be happy see this video;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4P5Pmdvg...About Psychiatry see this video:http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...Understanding Psychiatry:&quot;Psychiatry is not the same as neurology; whereas neurology treats diseases that have their aetiology or their physiology known and proven by medical science, psychiatry treats mental conditions where aetiology and physiology are both unknown and unproven.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_dise...  Psychiatry is not the same as Psychology; whereas Psychology studies the cognitive and subconscious mental processes of man with no regard towards physiology; Psychiatry studies theoretical mental disorder with the assumption that those disorders are based on physiological deficiencies. Psychology develops therapies aimed to improve mans cognitive processes; whereas Psychiatry develops physiological treatments to treat theoretical physiological deficiencies where aetiology and physiology are both unknown and unproven.The unscientific assumption that mental disorders are based on physiological deficiencies creates an arbitrary that makes any further research done by Psychiatry unscientific. You can’t base science on assumptions and arbitraries. Psychiatry treats theoretical mental disorders with theoretical physiological treatments. Examples of Psychiatric theoretical mental disorders: Premenstrual dysphonic disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome.Gender identity disorder: If you are gay you have this disorder. Female orgasmic disorder: Many types of conditions are under this code.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-IV_Code... As you see, these mental disorders are actually unscientific arbitraries based solely on opinion.Examples of Psychiatric theoretical physiological treatments: 1st ExampleElectroconvulsive therapy is a barbaric treatment where brain damage is induced into the patient by passing 70 to 200 volts of electricity through your brain. The electro shock and the heat further produce more brain damage by the effect decomposition and toxicity of dead brain cells. The only benefit of Electroconvulsive therapy is that it produces memory loss and amnesia. So the patient forgets its problems. Electroconvulsive therapy has caused death, coma and disabilities on patients. http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=... “About 100,000 people in the USA undergo ECT every year.”“The most commonly accepted theory is that ECT&#039;s mechanism of action is similar to that of antidepressant drugs and involves neurotransmitters, in particular dopaminergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems.”Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconv...2nd Example:Lobotomy is another barbaric treatment developed by Psychiatry in the name of mental health. In this procedure brain damage is induced into the patient by cutting the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex or simply destroying it.“Even lobotomy&#039;s proponents admitted that only one third of the operated patients would improve, while one-third remained the same, and one-third got worst (25 to 30 % is the proportion of spontaneous improvement in many kinds of mental diseases! Thus, a large proportion of the operated patients could have recovered without the lobotomy).http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n02/histo...3rd Example: The chemical imbalance theory, this theory alleges that serotonin deficiency in the brain causes depression. The following video explains this theory.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR9vtdueu...But this theory is not based in science and experts disagree:“I spent the first several years of my career doing full-time research on brain serotonin metabolism, but I never saw any convincing evidence that any psychiatric disorder, including depression, results from a deficiency of brain serotonin. In fact, we cannot measure brain serotonin levels in living human beings so there is no way to test this theory. Some neuroscientists would question whether the theory is even viable, since the brain does not function in this way, as a hydraulic system”Stanford psychiatrist David Burns, winner of the A.E. Bennett Award given by the Society for Biological Psychiatry for his research on serotonin metabolism, when asked about the scientific status of the serotonin theory in 2003.“Although it is often stated with great confidence that depressed people have a serotonin or norepinephrine deficiency, the evidence actually contradicts these claims”Professor Emeritus of Neuroscience Elliot Valenstein“Indeed, no abnormality of serotonin in depression has ever been demonstrated”Psychiatrist David Healy, former secretary of the British Association for Psychopharmacology and historian of the SSRIs, in Let Them Eat Prozac (2004).“A sugar pill was more effective than either St. John’s Wort or the antidepressant Zoloft in providing relief to severely depressed patients, according to a new study that is unlikely to end the debate about the role of the popular supplement in treating the disorder.”http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3076831/“…I wrote that Prozac was no more, and perhaps less, effective in treating major depression than prior medications…. I argued that the theories of brain functioning that led to the development of Prozac must be wrong or incomplete”Brown University psychiatrist Peter Kramer, author of Listening to Prozac, which is often credited with popularizing SSRIs, in a clarifying letter to the New York Times in 2002.“Some have argued that depression may be due to a deficiency of NE [norepinephrine] or 5-HT [serotonin] because the enhancement of noradrenergicnor serotonergic neurotransmission improves the symptoms of depression. However, this is akin to saying that because a rash on one’s arm improves with the use of a steroid cream; the rash must be due to a steroid deficiency”Psychiatrists Pedro Delgado and Francisco Moreno, in “Role of Norepinephrine in Depression,” published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in 2000.We must be able to differentiate real scientific research against special interest research. The fact is that the chemical imbalance theory is unfounded because:1)   A connection of ‘emotional states’ and neurotransmission levels have not been established.2)   It is impossible to measure the serotonin levels in living human beings.3)   There is no evidence that brain cells produce and then reabsorb serotonin.In the following video two college professor explain exactly what I’m saying in Fox News: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbTqjSfMP...We must understand that psychiatric drugs are a multi billion dollars industry, and that careful marketing campaigns are created to push these drugs. We can even say that the whole “Chemical Imbalance Theory” was created in an effort to market these drugs. We can also say that anti-depressants are actually a marketing name for stimulants and anti-psychotic are actually a marketing name for depressants.Three types of drugs:Narcotics: (OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet), also known as analgesics or opiods are drugs that are prescribed for moderate to severe physical pain. They are abused because of their euphoric, sedating, and numbing effects. Narcotic abuse causes tolerance and dependence and the withdrawal symptoms are severe.Depressants: (Xanax, Valium, Librium) are drugs that are prescribed to treat anxiety and sleep disorders. They are abused because of their sedating properties. With abuse, depressants cause tolerance and dependence and the withdrawal symptoms can be severe.Stimulants:  Ritalin, Dexedrine, Meridia) are prescribed to treat ADD/ADHD and other conditions such as asthma. They are abused because of their energizing and euphoric effects. Stimulants do not generally cause tolerance or dependence but abuse is associated with hostility and paranoia. There is also great risk for cardiovascular failure and seizures.-Ritalin: Prescribed for individuals (usually children) who have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has a high potential for abuse and produces many of the same effects as cocaine or amphetamine.  http://www.streetdrugs.orgPsychiatrists are not common people. Psychiatrists have a different point of view than the rest of society:  “A recent survey in the UK found that 83 per cent of psychiatrists thought that ECT( Electroconvulsive therapy) was more likely to be beneficial than harmful – this figure fell to 69 per cent of mental health nurses and 14 per cent of psychologists.”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconv...So how come Psychiatrists have such a different point of view than Psychologists and the rest of society? Whereas Psychologists confronts the human mind or psyche and understand that each person behaviors is an evolution of his own personal experiences. Psychiatrists are unable to confront the human psyche; Psychiatrists don’t care about your emotional issues or traumas; Psychiatrists only deal with man as an object, a biomechanical machine incapable of controlling his mental processes. How else can you explain Psychiatry barbaric treatments? Like Electroconvulsive therapy, Lobotomies, strait jackets and severe drugging of patients. For them you are not a person; for them you are only a biomechanical machine. People that join the Psychiatric profession do it in order to learn to deal with man in a mechanical way. The real role of Psychiatry in society is that they are psyche executioners of society. Whenever a person doesn’t conform with the behavioral rules of society they can be sent to a Psychiatrist. And the Psychiatrist enforces the person to conform by the use of multiple control mechanisms; these mechanisms are drugs, electroshock, lobotomies and incarceration (When you are committed into a Psychiatric hospital against your will you are being incarcerated and your freedom is taken away from you. After this the patients are so scared that they will do anything in order to get out of that place.). The behavioral rules of society are clearly expressed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.http://www.drugawareness.org/http://www.adhdfraud.org/http://www.escapefrompsychiatry.org/http://www.antipsychiatry.org/http://www.mindfreedom.org/http://www.endofshock.com/http://www.stopshrinks.org/http://www.gwenolsen.com/http://psychrights.orghttp://www.prescriptionsuicide.com/http://www.breggin.com/http://www.healthyskepticism.org/http://www.aspire.us/
Nausea with Celexa, will switching to another SSRI help?|3|I tried a low dose of Celexa (20mg) and it made me extremely nauseous!! Did anyone have a similar side effect and had a success by switching to a different SSRI? Like Zoloft perhaps?|Only a dr will be able to help you with a change, but from personal experience, I was on Zoloft and it was horrible.  It made me feel like a zombie.  I couldn&#039;t do anything for myself.  I just sat around with no direction.  I felt trapped in my body.But everyone is different on medicines.  So, I would talk to your dr before stopping your medicine.  Have you tried taking it with food?|Do you know what an SSRI does?  Do you know what SSRI means?   Have you attended physical anatomy classes to give you the knowledge of what causes you to sleep?  Do you know what Serotonin is?  Do you know what Serotonin does? Do you understand how Serotonin is produced in your body?  One medical word is Gastroparesis.  &#039;Paralyzed stomach.&#039;What is happening is the Serotonin receptors in your stomach are being blocked and and the stomach does not digest Serotonin.  And the Serotonin is making you nauseous.  So, switching from one SSRI to another will not change anything.It&#039;s a funny thing though!  Hitler did extensive research in his prison camps to determine the many different ways to change the body.  Seems to me the doctors could come up with something different, but they haven&#039;t!
Umm, whats would the effect of overdosing on Celexa be?|4|Is taking 350 mg of Celexa considered overdosing? What can this cause?

In the future, follow the recommended dose.|drugs and backteria i think.|all the bad side effects of speed.. with out any of the fun.  in that situation a doctor should be called or go to an er
Anyone wean themselves off of Celexa once pregnant?|4|I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for a few years for anxiety, and just found out I&#039;m pregnant last week.  I&#039;ve started to wean myself off (I don&#039;t have a Dr. appt until next month), and have been doing a full pill every other day, instead of every day.  I&#039;m having some side effects- just feeling &quot;out of it&quot; today.  Does anyone have suggestions on how to wean off, or what worked for them?  Thank you!|I would definitely do half a pill everyday if you can. The way you are doing it will confuse your body and make you sick or &quot;out of it&quot; because the levels of the chemicals in your body are fluctuating so much every other day. If you can do that, then I would take half of one every 36 hours or so. Eventually make the doses smaller/farther apart.|I&#039;m surprised your doctor wont see you until next month.After you get this settled out, you should find a better doctor.|Because you are pregnant, your hormones are going to be on a rollercoaster and you will not be able to take meds to control this.  You need to talk to your doctor about this for sure, but these are my suggestions of natural ways to control anxiety.1. Sunlight and fresh air- 10 minutes will provide you with your daily supplement of vitamin D which controls your emotions in ways you would not believe.  Fresh air will allow space for your fears and frustratings- unlike being cooped up in a house or office.2. Plenty of vitamin C and D.  If you take too much your will excrete the extra in your urine.  OJ, fruit, milk and leafy greens are big in these vitamins.3. Prenatal Vitamins- these are a must to make sure your body is carrying all it needs.  Make sure you get tested for any deficiancies so you know if you need more or less of something... 4. Healthy Eating- a must!  Remember to drink PLENTY of fluids as well!!5. Physical activity- you don&#039;t have to become a gym buff... a simple walk will do.  Yoga is also a great way to get your activity and remind your body to relax.6. Sleep- Get 7 to 9 hours a night for sure.  Take small 20-30  minute naps if you need more, but remember to not over sleep as well.7. EFT- a lot of people find that they have a simple technique that can help them through (I am attaching a website for info)... breathing or tapping or a certain movement or meditating.8.  Focus on the positive.  Remind yourself that something amazing and wonderful is coming to you soon.  Don&#039;t think about the worrying issues... only the baby&#039;s beautiful face or how sweet they&#039;ll smell or how wonderful it feels to hold them.  9. Get an ultrasound- I went to a place that did a sequence of ultrasounds and put it together as a book of growth of 4d ultrasounds.  It was so amazing to see them change and I watched the videos constantly when I started to worry.  It made me feel better to see they were okay and it was a great way to focus my energy on something postive.10.  Keep yourself busy.  Don&#039;t over do it, but make sure you have something you can put your mind to and make yourself feel useful.  If you can create a feeling of accomplishment, you will give yourself a natural high.  Focus on decorating the nursery or helping the homeless... something that you will see results from. These are the only things I know work... and while they don&#039;t work for everyone they will help you be the healthiest you can be and you are bound to find what works for you.  Many blessings your way!HTHAnimalcrackers247
For those taking Celexa(Citalopram), what do you use for headaches?|2|I&#039;ve been taking it almost one week and so far so good.  Normally for a headache I take ibuprofen or naproxen(Aleve).  However, it is not recommended to take anything with NSAID&#039;s along with Celexa.  For those who use Celexa, what do you use for headaches?  I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s a side effect.  I&#039;ve only had one, and I was sneezing at the same time, so I maybe caught a small cold.|The reason they tell you  not to take NSAIDs is due to the risk of bleeding.  You can take tylenol for headaches with celexa.
How does celexa effect the birth control pill?|3|will the pill still be as effective? i have been on celexa for a month and a half now. and was wondering this|No worries on that, girl.  The only troubles I&#039;ve had were with anti-siezure meds (Lamictal) and some MAOI&#039;s.  SSRI&#039;s generally had no effects...|Escitalopram (=Celexa) and birth control pills have no known interactions -and no known way they could interact at least according to a very large medicine -interaction data base and the manufacturer&#039;s data. On the other hand a lot of other medications may affect birth control pills, for example some antiepileptics like carbamazepine (Tegretol) and phenytoin (Dilantin), so Lamictal is by far not the only one.Marya

Are 10 mg tablets of Celexa likely to work in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder?|2|Because thats what I&#039;ve been prescibed and I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m just wasting time and money to see if they work. So far its been 6 days and I don&#039;t feel any less anxious.|Medicines like that usually take a week or up to 3 to work- I knwo from experience, I was on antidepressants and ritalin for 2 years, and I was on anxiety medicine for 2 months before my mom stopped it.Give it time, and during your next appointment, talk to your doctor if you feel it isn&#039;t working, and he may increase the dosage or give you a different medication.
What are some alternatives to Celexa and Trazodone?|4|I&#039;ve been taking both for my anxiety and depression for the past two months. They worked alright in the first month but now I&#039;m just &quot;eh&quot;. I&#039;m not like I was before the meds, but I&#039;m kinda...well...&quot;eh&quot;. You know? So is there anything else that can take me from &quot;eh&quot; to &quot;yay!&quot; ? I asked my doctor about it but apparently my mom said no. D:|Abilify has worked best for me; also Clonopin|Have you tried Wellbutrin?|A previous answer follows: In &quot;Handbook for Happiness - Exploding the Depression Myth&quot;, by Lorraine West, ( ISBN 1 920923 22 5 ) she advises, and I paraphrase here: Take the responsibility for your recovery on yourself, and stop being a passive consumer of goods, and services, expecting others to make you feel better, and looking for solutions to problems in &quot;magic pills&quot;.  Some exceptions may apply, for those who are suicidal, or totally unable to cope with things, like feeding themselves, who may need the quicker acting antidepressants, in which case, the risks may be acceptable.  Many doctors are only trained to prescribe various types, and strengths of antidepressants, and counselling. If the depression proves to be resistant, their next approach is to recommend ECT, with its 1 in 50,000 risk of death, and the possibility of permanent, partial memory loss. Talk therapy isn&#039;t very effective, when there is a medical cause, such as nutritional deficiencies, There are many other things you can do to help treat your depression. Moderate exercise for at least 20 - 30 minutes, daily, and up to an hour. Brisk walking is good, and try to be mindful of the feeling your foot makes as it hits the ground: it is a relaxation technique. Also use daily, one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 2.c, 2.i, or 11, and/or yoga, Tai Chi, and/or the EFT, in sections 2.q, 2.o, and section 53, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris whichever works best for you.  Screening quizzes for depression are via page E, in section 1, or page J, in section 2. If positive, print, and consult a doctor, to eliminate medical causes, and ask for an appropriate referral. Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain).  As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John&#039;s wort, (a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in efficacy; take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, Inositol, or 5HTP (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55 at ezy-build ). Initially, at least, some form of counselling, preferably either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy. Co-counselling is shown in the first 3 pages of section 2, or online therapy, or even talking with someone you feel comfortable with, and a much more detailed post is on page R. For females, also view page V: &quot;women to women&quot;, and if young; young women&#039;s depression. For males, view male depression. Teens: teen depression, and there is also a page on depression in children. Eventually, read the section. Anxiety is addressed in section , at ezy build; see page N first. It is necessary to wean off medication, If you decide to taper off, take at least 2 weeks, and see the first 3 pages of section 2, and page Z.22, if using Lexapro, or a benzodiazapene, which take considerably longer, before trying the wort. The wort also has an anxiolytic effect, and no tolerance develops.

I take Celexa for anxiety. Is there any allergy medicines that interact with Celexa that I should not take..?|2|Take Celexa, is there any allergy medicines that would interact with Celexa in which not to take?|Negative emotions (like sadness, stress, anger, etc.) causes your Serotonin production to be low; when your Serotonin level is low, you are more prone to getting Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, etc.Medication like Antidepressants (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) helps to boost Serotonin level.But there are natural ways to do it without medication. There&#039;s this herb called &quot;St John&#039;s Wort&quot; - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John&#039;s Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.If you&#039;re unable to take St John&#039;s Wort, you can substitute it with Siberian Ginseng or Licorice Herb.The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that &quot;learned behavior&quot; in your mind.

Otherwise, just take it in the morning since it helps most while you&#039;re awake, then stick to that time.|celexa has the side effect of sleepiness so nighttime is best. i&#039;m on it and i think its easier to remember to take it at night. as long as you are consistent it doesnt matter
Do your boobs hurt and do you have water retention when trying to get of celexa?|3|I have only been on celexa for a month and have gained about 15 lbs after coming of paxil from gaining weight. So I am going off all these and am going to try wellbutrin. Well anyways i was just all this water retention is from getting off the celexa?|yes|Talk to your doctor or psych
Does the anti deppressant/ SSRI Celexa cause organ damage?|2|A freind of mine told me Celexa can cause kidney/liver damage.  I&#039;ve been taking celexa for about 8 months now and I&#039;m not sure what I should do.  If anyone knows anything I&#039;d appreciate it.|Only if you abuse it
Why SSRIs (Celexa, Lexapro, etc) are much more popularly prescribed than Bupropin (i.e., Wellbutrin)??|4|I had tried Lexapro and Celexa, and i felt sleepiness more than I used to. And now, my doc prescribed me with Wellbutrin. Thinking to get more opinions before I start taking it.|Wellbutrin actually wakes you up and you feel a lot more chipper.  It also has much lower instances of sexual side effects.  However, doctors usually prescribe it as an addition to SSRIs in order to counteract instances of sexual dysfunction (like in my case).|I&#039;m not sure why any one prescription would be prescribed more than another, but all are different. The key is finding what works for you.  It sounds like your doctor is trying to prescribe a medication which  has the least side effects.|You are fine.Do you want to be a homeless hippie with me?

What antidepressant is better than Celexa?|3|For depression related to body image?|Celexas gave me a stomach ache, even when taken with food.  Effexor had a minor effect on me, so now I am on Lexapro.  This has had a better effect on me.  I changed antidepressant medication 3 times in about 4-5 months. Everybody is different, so you may have to try different medications until you find one that works.  Good Luck!|Zoloft; Wellbutrin XL; Paxil; Cymbalta
Ive recently been put on the drug celexa for my anxiety but im reading online that it causes weight gain?|4|part of my anxiety stems from being a little over weight i cant be taken a drug thats just gonna make me gain more please real answers how true is this is it just talk or is this fact if u have details please.|My husband has been taking it for about 2 1/2 years and has remained the same weight.  He was a pretty big guy to begin with (6&quot;, 275) but his pants size hasn&#039;t changed or anything. And neither have his eating habits.If you need the anti-depressant, take it.  If you start to gain obscene amounts of weight talk to the doctor about a different drug.  My hubby has had good luck with the celexa.|I was on Celexa for a while and I did gain weight but everyone is different. I wasn&#039;t an active person when on the medication and probably wouldn&#039;t have gained it if I were. The important thing is that you get well and if Celexa works for you then you can deal with the weight gain, if any, later.|Everyone is different...

How does celexa differ from other anti depressants? ?|2|I have taken different anti depressants before but none of them seem to work. now I am on celexa, and I am starting to feel better. what makes it different from the other medicine? thank you!|The SSRI antidepressants vary minorly in potency,  molecular shape and so on. Celexa is actually the &#039;same&#039; antidepressant as Lexapro. Lexapro just contains the active enantiomer.However. Those relatively mild, insignificant changes in potency, receptor affinity and metabolism are absolutely key in finding the &#039;right&#039; med for you. The one that clicks with your brain and really works to treat your depression. Sometimes, it can be rather hard to find the one that works right for you. It&#039;s all a matter of what genes you have and how your brain is put together - we think. One of the big things that mental health wants right now is a set of tests they can give someone to figure out which drug will work best, rather than having to go through trial and error.
I want to taper off of my Celexa?|5|I have taken Celexa for quite a few years now and I would like to taper off of it. I take 20mg a day. Does anyone have any advise as to how I should do this?|You sure that&#039;s wise? Yeah, I have an idea, but its different for everyone. Being on it a few years though, that&#039;s going to be a bit of a haul to be honest. You&#039;re going to have to go to the doctor with this, who will work you through a program based on your current dose to minimize the possible side effects. It works something like this though, on a weekly basis - initially you half your dose for a week, then perhaps only take that dose every second day, third day until you&#039;re ready to come of it completely.|First take to your Dr. about cutting back on it and maybe eventually getting off it. They can give you the instructions you really need.===|I took it for many years- and actually switched to Cymbalta- as the Celexa was starting to make me tired.  It was a very smooth transition.But as for tapering off to go back to nothing, are you doing it under the supervision of your doc?They will give you the best way to do it.  I remember that if I didn&#039;t take it for a couple of days, my eyes would get all funky- like a delayed response to things.  Drove me crazy.Good luck- be careful.Try checking out this site- you may read some things that will help-   www.askapatient.comsearch for Celexa.|Definately talk to your doctor.  I tried to taper off myself, and I had some WEIRD symptoms.  Like someone else has said, messed up eyes, and I almost felt like I kept getting little electrical shocks.  Not painful or anything, but just felt weird for a few weeks.  Just tell your doctor that you&#039;d like to try to work your way off of it.  Good luck!
Which is better for Anxiety- Paxil or Celexa?|10|I took Paxil about 6 years ago for panic attacks and loved it.  I went off because of weight gain and have tried several other SSRIs in between.  I recently switched to Celexa but still feel some anxious.  It seems like the Paxil worked better, but it could be since it was the first med I took that the results seemed more dramatic.  I am considering switching back to Paxil and would appreciate any insight.Thanks!|Paxil, for certain.|Paxil is a terrible drug.You can google the lawsuits and the problems and withdrawls and complications and legal problems and all that involved with it.

Does anyone know side effects of going off celexa medication?|7|Does anyone know side effects of trying to get off celexa&gt;|As a healthcare provider I beg of you: Do not discontinue antidepressants without consulting your provider. Not necessarily because of bad reactions. But because many people do this whenever thier depression is gone and they mistakingly think they don&#039;t need thier medication anymore. The fact is that if you are feeling better it is usually because the medication is working....and if you quit taking it  the depression will return. I don&#039;t know the particular facts and circumstances of your situation.,but a good thing to remember  is this: &quot;if it ain&#039;t broke...don&#039;t fix it&quot;  If your feeling better.....the med is working.|There are no side effects at all.  I have gone off of it several times and had no issues, although if you do decide to go back on, all that headache and stuff will come back.   If the issue is not being able to pay for them I would like to suggest that i am taking a generic version of celexa called citralopram that only costs 20 dollars for 30 pills at 40mg.  I hope i helped you,|First of all I will tell you what some others already have, everyone is different and please do not stop taking them without your doctors knowledge and help.  The side effects of taking Cymbalta were so terrible for me that I just stopped taking them completely one day. The side effects of stopping it were terrible for me. I was dizzy, nauseous, tired, terribly depressed, shaky and I was in bed for a solid week. I am not trying to scare you, I just want you to know how very important it is to so this under your doctors care. When my doctor found out that I did it without him he got very upset with me and told me to never do anything like that again. Good luck :)|Going back into depression, talk to your doctor first.|It IS possible to find a solution for depression deep inside of you.  Medication may be a great benefit for serious cases, but only as a temporary crutch.  Choosing joy is within your reach.  I also recommend that you follow doctor&#039;s instructions for removing your dependence on a medication, and then never again let yourself become dependent on a drug to do what you can do by yourself, which is to choose happiness.|There&#039;s a number, you may not get any side effects, but EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. When I went off it, I got headaches and was nauseous for a good few weeks. There&#039;s a lot of scary ones actually... the best, best, best thing to do is to taper it off slowly, very slowly. There&#039;s a lot of good info on the web about Celexa/other SSRIs and their withdrawal effects and tapering off, I found one here about general SSRI discontinuation http://bipolar.about.com/library/weekly/... yes it&#039;s on a bipolar page, but the information is still valid if you&#039;re on it for depression or anxiety or OCD. Just do a Google or Yahoo search of &quot;celexa withdrawal&quot; and do some reading. SSRIs can be nasty things, really they can.Anyway, good luck, I hope this helps. Remember, it could take a long time top get off celexa... some people can&#039;t at all, really the withdrawal effects are that bad (sorry, I&#039;m not trying to scare you!) The best thing is to not take the drug longer than necessary, and to reduce the dose slowly.I really, really, really hope you do okay without it. Best of luck!

Hang with it and in a couple of weeks you should feel better.|what is this for moods swings?|Yes, this is a side effect that occurs rarely in Celexa.  If it continues, contact your doctor.

It is hard for me to distinguish which meds do what, but I did get particularly nautious (didnt spell that right.)

What are the affect&#039;s of taking Celexa (Citalopram) and drinking ?|3|Not much if you don&#039;t drink often, or a lot. Otherwise, you are drinking a depressant that is counteracting your anti-depressant.|It does tend to make you drowsy and a bit tired.  The literature advises against drinking with Celexa, however, I have found that it is no problem as long is you do it in moderation.  Just remember, it does make you more tired than when you drank before you were on it.Best of luck.|Before taking citalopram, remember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication.

Celexa for mild depression and anxiety?|5|I&#039;m 17 years old. I went to a psychiatrist today and she prescribed me celexa for anxiety and mild depression. I&#039;m pretty nervous about taking it. I&#039;ve done a little bit of research on celexa but i&#039;m wondering if anyone out there has taken it or is still taking it? what were the side effects, how long did they last, does it work for you, etc. etc? any feedback is appreciated.|hey there, I&#039;m 16 and on Celexa. (With Concerta). I&#039;m going to be completely honest, it doesn&#039;t help for me too much with the depression. But with depression and anxiety it&#039;s all about finding the right match for YOU :) It might work for you even though it&#039;s not great for me. The plus side is, it&#039;s GREAT for anxiety. I didn&#039;t realize it until I missed a day and was SO anxious that day, and forgot that it had felt like that before I went on Celexa. The only side effects are mild headaches the first week(for me). Nothing too bad :)Good luck! &lt;3- Adriana|I took it for a while last year, but I switched to another medicine.

Just starting Celexa.  Will the side effects subside?|3|I have only had 2 doses of Celexa.  Since then have been having bad abdominal discomfort, diarrhea (5+ times a day) and a nonstop horrible headache.  Will this pass, or should I try a different med?|Ouch, sorry you&#039;re taking this drug, it was horrible for me. I had the same symptoms you mention, added to trembling, yawning and just overall feeling like crap. It took me about a week or two to subside, then I had to stop taking it cause I ran out, and when I took it again weeks later I got so sick i was throwing up so I stopped completely, good luck!|I&#039;ve been on this drug for years and have never experienced side effects from it.  Are you sure it&#039;s the drug or maybe a viral illness?  Often times, side effects disappear when your body adjusts to the drug. If it&#039;s not tolerable, you may want to talk to your doctor about it.
Has anyone ever taken a otc sleep aid (such as unisom) with a celexa prescrition?|3|I am on celexa ow but still not sleeping very good and would like to know if anyone else has had a familiar problem like me.|Just call the pharmacy where you get your prescription filled and ask the pharmacist.

The anti-depressant CELEXA did it work for you? is it worth it?|5|Is CELEXA and other anti depressant drugs worth taking? I mean all the side effects, withdrawal effects , etc. Ive been told by many people not to go on them, and I have heard only a couple of people tell me positive things about them. Now im asking the yahoo community, is all the risks worth it? Do you people who went on them A/D have success?|i take celexa and i can tell a little bit that it works...i have been on it for a couple of months now...but when i forget to take it i know it the next day for sure. I also take buspar. the anti-depressants help but what really helped me was counsling. if you dont go to one i highly recommend you do. it works for me but you know all people are different. hope i helped :)oh and i never gained weight cuz of taking celexa...but like i said people are different.|Celexa is a good anti-depressant to try.  Usually there are no major side effects and a low dose of 20mg is very mild.  The only effects you may have is when you go off them you have to go slowly or else you can end up feeling dizzy.  Good luck.|Yes I do not like Celexa though I gained weight.I use Lexapro it helps me stay balanced and my mood swings are better.|ur sexy and ah no dat **** dnt work
I was told Celexa was same as Lexapro, anyone know if it is?|4|Two weeks ago my health care provide put me on Celexa because they claim my insurance wouldn&#039;t cover Lexapro. The first couple of days all the crazy thoughts stopped, but now two weeks later I&#039;m having them again don&#039;t know what to do, they say it takes a full 4 weeks.|Celexa is the original version of the med and Lexapro is its isomer that is supposed to have fewer side effects.  They&#039;re in the same class of anti-depressants, but they&#039;re not the same med.  It&#039;s the same molecule, but backwards.  People react differently to all psych meds, and these are no different.  Some people tolerate one better than the other or both or neither.  Give it a few more weeks to see if the Celexa starts working for you.|I think the answer above this is right.  I fortunately was able to get Lexapro, and it started working in a few days. A few weeks later I noticed other benefits of the drug. With antidepressants you will still have some bad days. What is happening to you is common. Sometimes things will happen that will reverse your progress for a short time. This usually happens in the first weeks. There is a drug that may consistently reduce the crazy thoughts. Klonopin is not an antidepressant, but it calms you down without making you tired. It works quickly and its effect lasts about 8 hours.  I was very satisfied with it until I got the full effect of Lexapro. Ask your doctor if you can take Klonopin for a few weeks.|They are similar Medications. Ins usually will pay for the less expensive one. It usually takes 4 to 6 weeks to get the levels up to where they need to be to be effective.
My fiance just started to take Celexa?|2|I have been on it for about 6 months. The only side affects when I forget to take it, I will get dizziness, vertigo, etc. My fiance started taking it about a week ago, and is getting weird side affects, jaw clenching, anxiety, etc.. Is this normal?|Celexa is said to be same as prozac. It should reliveanxiety not cause it. You might want to have fiancee check with his doc if he is already having side effects.good luck . oh I hear it make take quite a  few changes ofmeds before doc gets the best one for you. wish therewas a better answer.
Will Klonopin counter-act the trouble sleeping efftect of Celexa?|4|I&#039;m on celexa right now and the side effect of not being able to sleep is not good because I already have insomnia, but i&#039;m also on klonopin, will the klonopin counter-act against that side effect and help me sleep? I was taking klonopin prior to celexa and it was helping me sleep|I am on Lexapro......drepressionklonopin--to help sleep,,,only at night|Like you said, the klonopin was helping you sleep.  So, it should still help you sleep.  Take your Celexa in the morning and take a Klonopin before you go to bed|One why does your doctor have you on both meds? they both help with depression and anxiety. that might be whats wrong talk to the doctor that gave you the meds.
What are some side effects of Celexa?|2|I&#039;ve read some but is the worsening insomnia common? i just started it today and took it in the morning. I was on zoloft a while back and i remember it kept me up for 2 days straight and was wondering if celexa was similar, thanks|Insomnia is one of the common side effects. And other sleep disturbances.Unfortunately increased tiredness is not a side effect.If you are suffering from insomnia already before being put on Celexa then your Doctor hasn&#039;t done enough research in to the right medication for you.You would be better off with something like Avanza which has sedation as a common side effect.So killing two birds with one stone as the insomnia can add to the depression.With something like Avanza, your depression is being tackled so is the sleeplessness.This is what my son&#039;s Doctor did for him.He is now very happy with his depressionw ell controlled. And sleeps like a baby.

When I miss my celexa, the next day I end up flying off the handle much more than usual. Is this normal?|5|I have been on Celexa now for four years (with varying doses). I have noticed that when I miss a dose, I am a total b***h! I don&#039;t think this is a coincidence, because it has happened many times and I have realized it after I&#039;ve been grouchy. I didn&#039;t think that missing one would affect me that badly, that it would take time for it to come out of my system (eg have to be off it much longer). Anybody else notice this?|I used to take Lexapro, and my brother takes Paxil, and we each have noticed that our anxiety is worse on days we skip it.  I don&#039;t think this is the placebo effect.  Our bodies become very used to the amount of serotonin in our system, and when you miss a day it probably throws you off a little.|Missing one dose will not cause you to &quot;fly off the handle&quot; it is your choice to fly off the handle.  The drug is for anxiety and depression.  Everyone can have different side effects but you wouldn&#039;t change just because you missed one day.  It is you not the drugs.  It takes about 4-6 weeks for the drug to start working in your system and about the same for it to wash out.|get cleaned up and stop using compounds to change how you feel.
